5265,4,PTron Intunes,"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

5285,4,PTron Intunes,"Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

5286,4,PTron Intunes,"very nice product. Sound quality is awesome. good fitting inside ear. battery backup is approx 2.5-3 hours. best piece of tech in this price range
",5
5287,4,PTron Intunes,"Really loved this product and will recommend it to everyone. The product looks fancy yet is not expensive. I opted for grey color but other two variants are equally appealing. Takes negligible time to connect with server. Sound quality is very good and those magnet provided at the back of ear plugs makes it very handy to carry. Battery life is also good plus the noise cancellation is also effective. Overall it is a good product, worth the price and one should go for it.

I am totally satisfied with this and couldnt say about battery as i have got it, today itself!
",5
5292,4,PTron Intunes,"The product is surprisingly good. I thought at this price the functioning Will be basic. But they have included volume keys too. Audio quality and noise cancellation is also satisfactory. But the battery backup is very low. I'm only getting around 2.5 hrs backup while using calls. Also it starts saying ""Low battery!! Please charge!!"" once the charge is below 20% repeatedly making it literally unusable
",4
5293,4,PTron Intunes,"These are excellent bluetooth earphones as expected! The sound is clear with  music , videos and phone calls. The caller can be heard very clearly as well as the caller can hear me with no disturbances. Also along with these ear - plugs are so that the chances of sliping reduces. It is best for  travelling as it is bluetooth earphones. Along with this you will be getting charging wire and main benefit is that you will be getting 1 year warranty with it😍😍😍

5306,4,PTron Intunes,"Sound quality is good however I am afraid of one of the function that is connecting multiple device on bluetooth at the same time.

5477,4,PTron Intunes,"1) the length of the wire is a  couple of inches short2) extremely heavy on one side and keeps falling off from the ear beause of the weight.3) the buds provided with the headset are loose. The bud stays in the ear while the ear phone pops out.4) within a day of using the headset the buds fell off and got lost.  There after unable to use this product. The ear phone don't fit properly in the ear without the buds.5) the Bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.6) no warning before shutting off, because of low charge. If you are in a call, there is hardly any warning of low battery.
