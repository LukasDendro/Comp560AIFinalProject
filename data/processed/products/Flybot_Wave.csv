5002,2,Flybot Wave,"SOUND QUALITY of flybot wave wireless earphones is good,but very good when the earphone CONNECTIVITY is also good, in middle of playing songs automatically song is intermittently music play, disconnected and also connected but why disconnected ,(I connected and using the Bluetooth in between 10 metre,and also Company written this In box Bluetooth transmission  range is 10 metre, so why disconnected, I will show this in photo)  , stopped ,and also fitting is very poor (I do jumping jacks ,dance, I adjusted the earphones everytime also  when I am running because earphones is not perfectly fitting I also change buds but nothing happens same problem produced) and also in one pair buds , one bud is small and other one is big I will show by clicking photo, COMFORT soft and lite in weight  but main problem is poor fitting,and CONNECTIVITY.

5004,2,Flybot Wave,"Its an awesome purchase but the mike doesn't quite cancel the surrounding noise that well...The other person on the call just hears too much for your liking as well as while playing music the bass isn't that great..but good enough at this pricing.

",5
5014,2,Flybot Wave,"First thing first, there is no bass at all only shrill treble. Bluetooth connectivity breaks down beyond 3 meters while it's falsely claimed that it has a range of10 meters. Absolutely no proof of them supporting bluetooth version 5 as claimed on the website . Chinese product with a lot of exaggerated claims.Last but not the least, the headphones have a very poor in ear grip and keep falling out despite the extended over the ear additional support. Changing the earbuds also doesn't help solve the problem.Returned them for them being very ordinary headpu that couldn't provide any real listening pleasure.

",5
5019,2,Flybot Wave,"Do NOT buy this product, even with nice discounts offered. I got cheated out of 800 rupees. For one, the bluetooth earphone is extremely defected. After a couple of weeks, my phone kept repeating ""Volume maximum"" despite it not being so and the earphone was causing disruption on my phone, unable to play properly. Now, it charges but has simply stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money on this product.

",2
5026,2,Flybot Wave,"It is very good product under this price but its Bluetooth connection is very weak which is disturb during song
",4
5027,2,Flybot Wave,"The earphones are water resistant. The control stick is not. They stop working as soon as the tiniest bit of sweat reaches them. Plus they are useless if you're sprinting or doing a high intensity activity. The control stick is place in an unbalanced manner, which causes the right earpiece to slip out slowly
",1
5028,2,Flybot Wave,"I got this the first time, the earpiece was broken and kept falling out. I returned it, and the second time the Bluetooth connectivity was horrible. It kept disconnecting after 2 minutes. I expected so much better, and the company never replied about warranty either.

5139,2,Flybot Wave,"I have been using this earphone since past a week. Must say, this is best in this price range. Best suggestion to someone whos looking for bluetooh earhone in this price range... im listing the pros and cons below. if you want.pros:1. sound quality and noise cancellation is above expectation2. Bluetooh Conectivity is fast.3. Charges quickly. it hardly takes me 30 mins charge.4. Charge last more than 4 hrs for continous users. for moderate users it would last 7-8 hrs depending upon ussage.5. Good quality of earbuds that fits perfect in ear and wont hurt for continuos use.cons1. connectivity is wont last longer tha 2.5 mtrs.2. fits slight loose over ear, if you have small ears like i have.Note:havent checked the water resistivity yet. But as of my routine this earphone is resistive to slight swet
",5
5140,2,Flybot Wave,"Keeping the cost in mind and the Amazon's tag as a promise i bought this product and uts been a week since now and here is my review about the product.The initial impressions of the product is good and the build quality feels solid.It packs all the usual stuff which includes ear tips and other things.The design of the product seems good with a nice fit which helps in doing some exercises while in use.Water resistant and sweat resistance functionality adds to the usage of the product under various conditions.Coming to the performance, it definitely does good with some decent bass and the clarty is good.Coming to the cons i dont feel there are many but the bass might be an issue for some people who use too high bass but thankfully thats not an issue for me.Overall a worthy product
