5543,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Good build quality; Good battery backup; ease with BT connection; good design & fit; Sound quality is very good - crisp & clear; mid tone is excellent; treble is little harsh but can be easily control through equalizer software; bass is sufficient; lastly, voice clarity through mic is excellent - best in the market (even better than Sennheiser). Most importantly, its Samsung and one can take the benefit of readily available service centres, if required.

5546,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Its getting disconnected frequentlyWhen iam listening to music and stop it, then go to youtube, then the sound is coming through phone speaker even though the headphone is connected.Then i have to diconnect the bluetooth and then reconnect. Then only it will work.Not sure whether the piece is defective or the model itself is like thatReally dissapointed

5547,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"just go for it. Highly recommend product. Better than any bluetooth earphones I have tried even at double the price. Better than original level U, Tagg inferno . Samsung says battery is 10 hours, I get 12 hours. Range is commemdable. Around 40mtrs easily. Looks good. Sounds good. Dual drivers, expected nothing less. only con is, the. wires are a bit on thinner side. But Samsung warranty policy is nice. They just replace your product with a new one.

5548,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.
",1
5549,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"frequently getting disconnected in d middle of watching videos or listening.. Previously bought Cross beats... comparing to that.. Samsung is really waste.. I had waste the amount and its not worth for it..
",1
5550,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Sound quality is awesome, I am a frequent traveller of train & bike, I love active noise cancelation, no interruption of BT connection & battery life great. Comfy piece, yes It takes 2 3 days to get comfy with ear piece as it is heavy & big but one can get familiar with it very soon. Only draw point is earpiece cable robustness. Very thin & breakable cable used for both ear piece. It may get broken on very slight pull. Please be careful. Else excellent.
",5
5551,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"This is one of the best earphone I have ever used. Quite comfortable to use with superb quality sound. With samsung level app you can customise the sound effect to your liking. All the battery backup is very good and will easily survive a whole day of usage.

",1
5554,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Waste of money. Amazon had marked it as under return / refund but when I asked for refund they denied and instead offered me replacement. When product is a crap what we will do with replacement. Endless issues with this product:- very frequently disconnect- Ear piece are very heavy- many issues while using it on laptop- can't take calls reliably through laptop- voice issue while on laptop

5555,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"The sound is very clear , bass is normal ( not for bass heads people ) , build quality is awesome , you can customize the bixby button to your fav app ( Google assistant ) , battery is about 9 hrs for me !! the earphon look premium must buy if you have budget of 4k
",5
5556,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Doesn't retain charge even for 2 songs, gets discharged even while not in use & switched off. This is a horrible product by Samsung. Never Buy.

5557,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"This is one of the best neckbands in the world, with the affordable price.  It unleashes the power of samsung phone.  Music lovers are recommended to use this.  It has approximately 12 hours of usages, change time is 45 minutes. It is comfortable and flexible (Obviously). Thank you Samsung. Thank you Apario and Amazon India for giving me the expected item.

",5
5562,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"I feel that this this is the best earphone in this range. I had few other bluetooth earphones which had many problems such as range,clarity,bass. This is the perfect choice for me.
",5
5563,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work
",5
5564,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Ossam looks, sturdy design, light weight. Not recommended For music lovers as sound is too metallic N poor bass (unless You forcefully push it in ur canal N align it at a certain angle which may b painful after prolonged use)  But a must have For calling. Connects 2 devices at a timeHowever after a few weeks use, I found That battery indicator is total waste. It may Show 100% once then suddenly drop yo 55% N then Keep steady at 55% N suddenly 0. So that's one thing samsung can improve in nxt update
",4
5565,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Very good product, provides good bluetooth connectivity, works with any bluetooth compatible device, nice and smart design, comfortable to wear and with a crisp sound quality.  Although not much of a bass but the sound quality is superb. Provides decent noice cancellation. Decent microphone.Superb product by Samsung and a very good delivery by Amazon. Delivered before time :)

5567,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Piece of junk.Don't buy this useless product.It's working 2 months after that start showing so much problems, like bettey run out fast, some times not even charge the head phone. It's only big name but product Is cheaper than chaina product. Whole West of money.
",4
5568,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"After checking many brand wired earphone purchased this one and it's really good on call sound is clear mostly using this while traveling on bike with helmet and i can hear other person voice clearly even noise cancellation also found very good loved it as per my view best product for traveler who constant need to attend call daily.

5574,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Its microphone placement is shaky and it has to be held to be able to speak into it, yet the voice heard at the other end is bad quality.

5731,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"I have purchased u flex from Croma and purchased another from reliance digital showroom. Whether it a a voice call or music, this is top rated bluetooth headphone. Samsung branding and premium quality looks is an add on. It works best with S8 and note8 above models (Dolby atmos) and it has a dedicated app for sound effects.The most important advice I would like to give u all is don't buy from Amazon or any other online websites. Croma / Reliance digital / Samsung showrooms are the only official sellers of this product.

5732,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

5733,6,Samsung EO-BG950CBEIN,"Audio started getting distorted in left earpiece by third week of purchase. It doesn't even charge now.Return window closed on 10th day, and this product has become unusable by 25th day of occasional usage(1-2hrs/day).I wish Amazon could return it to the seller and arrange for a replacement rather than us making countless trips to the service center.Utter Disappointment!!
