12177,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Skullcandy makes affordable quality products. I have had 5 different items during the course of last 3 years and not a single disappointment.Pros:-• 5-6 hours of battery with 'highest' setting of volume, maybe more with a lower setting.• Spare earbuds• Comfortable fit. For those who think the band may cause uneasiness, trust me, you won't even feel the band on your neck, it is featherlight.Cons:-• NoneBrilliant Bluetooth headset, highly recommend prospective buyers to invest in this quality product.

12178,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"The ones that i have are amazing , the charge lasts a over a day , longer than my phone's battery , connects almost instantly , stays put on your neck no hassles of falling off due to the rubber clip in front , never felt it heavy . The rubber is just perfect on your ears they dont hurt at all.  yes you may have to clean them once in 2 to 3 days so they dont give you an ear infection (that s the case with any ear phone ) a device worth the buy , has lasted me over 5months now . i expect it to last longer .:)

12179,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Many time it is unable to pair with more than one device at the same time. I want it to pair with my laptop and my phone. Sometimes it pairs and sometimes it does not. But overall it is good and battery life is good as well.Charging takes time, should be improved.

12180,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Amazing product,  sound quality is good.The best part of the product is, it is compatible with both android and ios.Perfectly fits around collar.Feather light.Go for black colour.
",4
12181,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Battery backup is fair as mentioned.Design is also good.Bass is also acceptable in the wireless category.The thing not liked about this device is frequent connection disturbance with the mobile, even when the mobile is almost 2 feet far from the headphones.Another thing I disliked about the voice quality of the caller. It is not clear even at this cost.

12182,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Service is pathetic of service centre never provide support skull Candy product once it starts problems, service center will not simply not support

12183,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Sound quality is good. Distorts sometimes. I am really not into technicality of sound related stuff but I can sense some distortion.Battery life : the box says it last for 7 hours, mine don’t last for more than 3-4.Durability wise, this thing looks delicate but I haven’t used it roughly.yet. So not sure if they are durable or not.

12185,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"The quality of the product,sound system and battery backup is too bad. Battery back up is really giving 80-90 minutes. but product says 6 hours back up.

Really worthless product I got in my hands and waste of money.

",5
12187,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"I used it for about a week and found is very good bass and sound clarity. Only bad part is that the comfort is lacking becouse of design of the earpiece and experiencing some breaks in music even while the mobile is in my pocket.

12347,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"the headphones worked for a year without a glitch, but almost a year later, the console became gummy and sticky, I used these headphones only while traveling in public transits(bus). The console cover got completely spoiled and came off the headphones totally leaving the inner circuit open, after that within a day or two headphones died completely. Now they are just a piece of dead garbage, doesn't even charge or get turned on.Skull candy provides 2 years warranty all across the world except India.WOW.... it's just a year of warranty u get in India and upon calling they told me that Skullcandy headphones cant be fixed in any other way and I have to buy a new one. This wasn't expected from Skullcandy, I am hugely disappointed with the product, my 3700 bucks are wasted. I would recommend not to purchase this garbage as it works only for a year.

As this is Bluetooth based wireless earphones it compresses the sound quality hence we don't get amazing sound quality as wired. I have compared this earphone with Sony SBH70 which is costlier then this but same result. So I will recommend this earphone at this cost the bass is good not amazing but mid range is amazing try listening song with 320kbps bit rate MP3 songs. Only disadvantage is you will not get the sound quality like wired one. Although it's best earphone at this price. Listen song just by tweaking equaliser you won't be disappoint.

12350,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"My first impresion on the Headset1.Great with music and good bass2.Great connectivity range3.Call connectivity average not much of noice cancellation.Major con for a wireless headset NO REDIAL AND VOICE DIALLING feature.With a price like this such basic features missing, did not expect.

12351,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Skullcandy Smokin' Buds 2 In Ear With Mic3 Black Chrome Bluetoothproduct quality only looks good.It doesn't has good Bluetooth receiver. It won't even remain in contact if you have your phone in lower pocket.It is not worth money. I would have returned it however I moved to other country after buying it and so can't return it.About sound quality :Poor than compared with lowered priced TAGG Bluetooth headset.Supplied earbuds are also not sufficient in size.

12352,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Good headphone for normal use, treble  a little high but can be adjusted using equaliser. In the ear experience is awesome also over the experience is also very good. It has a little lesser range of bluetooth though, signal interupts over closed doors. Output is not very loud but generally ok. Most importantly being a sports range headphone it is not waterproof, mine got damaged due to sweating in gym. Asked for replacement from ccare but no reply since 15 days.

12353,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Great productExcellent sound quality and mic is also quite clear for the receiver. I did see some comments around the range not being good, but I tested it in a range of approx 20 to 30 feets - through concrete walls are didn't find any issues.I do miss a mute function for the mic which would have made this more than perfect. I might be missing a trick here, but if anyone knows if there is a way to mute the mic without muting from the phone or laptop would be interested to know

12354,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"The controls stopped working within 3 months of use!!!!  After using for 10 minutes, they get disconnected automatically and the you have to charge them again to use and have to connect to a power supply to switch on the earbuds!!!!!  Bad quality.  They ate under warranty but you have to send the earphone to Noida at a cost of RS. 400+ , which you have to bear.  Even my Skullcandy Method stopped working but a bit later after using it for 10 months. Got a replacement but they too have stopped working after 15 days of use!!!!!Do not buy Skullcandy earphones, better buy Sennheiser Momentum wired for Rs. 4.5-5K.  Quality is much better.

12355,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"If you want a product for long term use then don't even think of this. Really Skullcandy headphones are shucks on durability. I hav wired version of this one and wireless version as well.It's just 40 days now all control buttons not working anymore. I was big fanboy of Skullcandy only for sound quality bt seriously if U want to waste your money then go for it. Both wired n wireless version shucks on durability wise.

12356,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Valure for money, was a bit worried but the sound clarity turned out to be really good and very portable, i haven't used it for a long time so cant talk about that, but its overall a really good wireless earphones unlike the bulky one's in the market. Go for it if ur tired of wire earphones.

12357,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Very poor quality of sound - almost sounds like a shriek on Iphones and equalizer setting aren't of much help. Very flat bass, Instead of this go for Skullcandy Ink'd. Quality of drivers is below average and sound quality poorer than a cheap 1000 Rs earphone. It's a downgrade from Skull Candy's own cheaper cousin Skullcandy S2IKW-J509 Ink'd Bluetooth earphone.

12358,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"pros:sound is good, not best in range, but good.cons:1. feels very cheap and fragile.2. while running, ears can feel the sound of impact.3. doesn't give clue about out side environment. a passing bus will be heard only when its a few foot away. which makes it unsafe for out side use

12359,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"These are amazing earphones for the price. I have bose wired earphones, I was looking for wireless earphones for gym and these fit my ear just fine.

I knew this before buying so not an issue for me.

12362,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Treble and bass are great.. But clarity is not up to mark..

12363,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Keeps coming off the neck very frequently. Sound quality is good but not awesome. But if u want to use it for running or in the gym this product is not for you. The sound may be overpowered if you are near the speakers on your gym.

12393,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"Of course I am big fan of Skullcandy but these are the best among all the others I own. Sound is subpar the skullcandy. For those who tangle free music experience these are really good.  All those bass lovers these are must to get.I love the neck band it has this blue led which gives really good effect for my workout videos.Even in gym when surrounded by loud music these work flawlessly.Pretty rough usable. Battery is good I was able to use upto 8hours without hearing that annoying beep.All in all for the amount the product is best.

12395,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"I have been using this headphones for a week now and I have never seen or heard a much more beautiful elegant earphones at all.  The best in bass and crisp raspy sound. People say that the neck band is slightly discomforting..  But I'd say No..  I wore them seeing 2 good movies back to back and I did not feel discomforting at all. Makes u feel as if this is not there on your ears and neck at all.Pros1)Perfect fit on the ears2)Very light weight compared to other wireless earphones on market3)Good Bass4)Amazing design and the neck bands do come out and go in very easily5)Very very quick and easy pairing for my One plus phone. BTW it supports dual pairing.6)Call connection is good and it my voice is very clearly audible for the other person while on phone. Mic is good.Cons1)Battery life isn't more than 6 hours as I fully charged the earphone and watched 2 movies back to back which was around 6.5 hours and it beeped for low battery.2) The earphones without the neck bands may be a little and I mean slightly little issue as they tend to slide back off the neck.  If the beck bands are attached, it stays put.3) No one touch Siri or Google now which is the only thing I did not like as I am a great fan of those. While driving if u want to call someone then u have got to remove your phone and dial which is sometimes irritating as I feel.On the whole this  is a beautiful piece of device for 60$ or 3200 INR. Please go for it as it's perfect for good listening with good bass and very comfortable for long hours of gym and musicHope you like my reviews and thanks for reading them.

12403,9,Skullcandy S2PGHW-174,"I purchased an SB2 wireless from a Skullcandy shop last year. For @ 6 months it worked well but one day it suddenly stopped working. It did not turn ON in spite of charging fully. I got a replacement as it was under warranty but the new piece also had the same issue after @ 6 months. As it was now out of warranty, I negotiated with the seller who gave me his display piece which again had the same issue within a couple of weeks. I tried various solutions available online to troubleshoot but it simply refuses to get switched on. This clearly proves that there is something fundamentally wrong with the product.I strongly advise against purchasing this product or rather any Skullcandy product for that matter.
