1,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

3,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.

9,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I can’t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. I use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn’t let me down at all.  This is a must buy for all music lovers.

13,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

16,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

18,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted.

19,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible
",1
20,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

26,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it.

I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"".

32,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.

33,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

35,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

36,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

37,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.
",1
38,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.
",2
39,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

40,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

41,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

44,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it.

45,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.Bought it socially for multipoint features.Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.

48,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

60,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

62,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

64,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

65,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can't comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

66,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The headphones are good, however the first one broke within one month, and boat replaced it, so kudos. Battery life is enough for one and half of my gym sessions, so I'd say between 5-6 hrs. Sound is clear with good depth.

67,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

68,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

70,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.Day 2,In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.Later I dint use it till the evening.Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

71,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

73,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

75,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries...

Its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material.  As this is in ear canal type speakers we.

81,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

83,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

84,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

85,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"CONS:-These earphones does not tell remaining battery till it is very low. A button should be there to know battery life.-After battery gets low they don't last more then 6 mins or so. Also voice assistant keeps shouting battery low. They become unusable.-More earbuds should be there. 3 sizes do not fit all.PROS:- Boat has best after sales support no other company comes close to them. Repair and replacements are completely hassle free. ""THIS IS WHY I PURCHASED THESE"".-Sound quality is good.-Build quality is good.-Water resistant-Battery lasts sufficiently long .

86,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

Also, earphones inside also didn't looked like fresh packaging. It really looks like It was used before.but I could be wrong and it could be just bad packaging also.sound is good though , average loud, but not very good. Range is good i can easily use it while moving in my house. You will always feel some disturbance while playing.Also, I tried connecting with multiple devices but it can not be done while it's connected to other device. First, you gotta disconnect it then it can be connected.

105,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This is a good buy. Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.To summarise, worth buying, if under 1500.

I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

118,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

119,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM. Overall I would buy again.Design wise, I like the Boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones  Otherwise a great product to buy!

121,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation.

122,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought this after searching many Bluetooth wireless earphones.Here is my review after using this product for one week with my OnePlus 6T.Pros-Battery life is good compared to other earphones.-Bass is good-Light weight even u can't feel it's around your neck-Noice cancellation is awesomeCons-Faced some issues in connectivity when mobile is in my trouser pockets(When holding mobile in hand,no issues at all)-Running with mobile in trousers also shows some interruption in hearing-Sometimes I hear unwanted noice (I think there is compatibility issues with OnePlus 6T and other devices too)-Battery charge is always showing 100% in 6T-Bass is good but I feel too noisy-The voice on connection and disconnection is weirdIf you are looking for wireless earphones under 1500,it is the best among the all! You can't get all the best features in this price range. So go for it!

123,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"For the first month it was good. But from the starting i was having blue tooth connectivity issue. It was not even having good connection within 5metres. Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done.

124,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"On time delivery and product is good.. the bass wasn't feeling great initially but after changing the in-ear buds with the bigger ones provided in the packing the sound was significantly better with better bass and treble. Easily connected to my mobile phone, Smart TV, and laptop. I got it on 26th October, today is 30th.. I have not had to charge it at all so far.. i use it for a couple of hours everyday.. so battery life also seems decent.It's good value for money. Would surely recommend.

125,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Everything is very good about this product. Great sound, I love it. However, if I I hadn't lost those ear plugs and their hooks that help u stick them in ur ear I would have given it a 5 star. They gave extra ear plugs but not those hooks that hold on to the crevices of ur ear to help u enjoy the bass. I can't find them separately on Amazon either. It would be great if Boat could include those in the package.

126,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is good. Bass is wonderful. Better life is awesome. There is no connecting issues. Before order I am very much doubtful about the performance of this earfone, because of reading some reviews in Amazon. But when I used this, I am very much satisfied. Amazon shipping is always good and prompt.

127,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

128,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality isn't that good. Not worth the cost. Durability, well it comes with a plastic construction, that you need to wear around neck. So can't fit it in anything.Feeling bad buying this product considering the image doesn't clarify the plastic ring around the neck. Oh yes one more thing Ear piece has rubber hook on it but design is so bad that you can't get it in ears properly.

129,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call.

130,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Everything is good, sound quality is awesome, look wise also decent but.....But battery life is bad, if you consider it for using a whole day battery may end up just before your day ends. Backup of 6-7 hours is not enough for a whole day use. If you want something with good battery life jabra elite 25e is what you are looking for but something with good sound quality this is what you are looking for but if you want both this thing in one, then sorry there is no such thing available i have searched and watched each and every earphones review but this technology seems to be failing you can even see that very few wireless mouse and keyboard have good ratings.

133,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Best headphones I have ever bought and I have tested quite a lot of them from a lot different brands n price range.. this one simply knocks all of them out of the field in terms of sound quality, bass, loudness and battery life.. Go for it without any hesitation and you won't regret your decision!And ya they stay in your ear n create a sound isolation too... Good for running too!

134,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Mid range is poor. The finer sounds are not extracted.The product is extremely light and u won't feel it's there. This is an awesome feel. Sooper bass and crystal clear pitch. Bluetooth connectivity is remarkable. I received it yesterday and played for 3. 5 hours without and drop in performance. Seems sturdy. Yes, while listening to audio from Gaana, was getting a 3D feel, as if am sitting midst of a concert.

In case of audio controlsDouble tap + button to increase volume & single tap for change next track.Double tap - button to decrease volume & single tap to previous track.Double tap o or middle button to dial last call, single tap 2 seconds for Google assistant, single tap immediate to play or pause music, single tap long press to on or off boat rocker or Bluetooth connectivity.If u charge daily 20 minutes it's enough for long day continues music.Overall Good product.

136,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"For the price it is offered I would recommend this . Noise cancellation is surprisingly good . Sound quality is also impressive but not the greatest for sure . Bass effect is more . Fit the ear perfectly and doesn't come off . Wire and exteriors are made of plastic but serves the primary purpose . Bluetooth slightly deteriorates when you keep the phone and move to another room with too many walls obstructing . But overall is a good deal . Battery lasts upto 6 hours .

Lately however, the earphones have stopped charging, the LED doesn't work and the earphones heat up substantially when I try to charge it.I have tried to register the product and a complaint on the vendor's website but always receive an error. I've tried calling them but the always receive a 'network busy' error. I have emailed them and awaiting a reply.Overall a really good product but if one can't get the product to work during the warranty period, there's no point in buying it.

143,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It's been 5 days only that I have bought this product....Cons:-10m bluetooth connectivity is a myth, it only supports upto 3-5 m.-wires are not quite durable or thick.-Bass is lower than average.-not durable for long run-ears starts to pain after a use of 30min.Pros:-gets charged quickly.-light weight-gets connected quickly,no problem in connection.So, for me this product is lower than average.Now it's up to you,so think twice before buying thus product.

144,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This is a very convenient and easy to use earphones. I had no issues with connectivity or battery as they are both good and reliable. The sound leans heavily on the bass side of things. For bass heads who like loud earphones, this is perfect. For people who want a more neutral sounding earphones, look elsewhere

145,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"W/L earphone in 1-1.5K price range. Handle carefully for 1st 1 week to understand different feature capability. Had many -ve reviews on Amazon but I still opted for it. Incidentally all is well till now after 1 month use. Little problem in call/audio management but that's not a major issue. Same feature of JBL is on higher price rande (4K) so not bad this one.

149,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

151,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought this product after a long wait for drop in price for 1500 finally but just after few days of buying it for 1500, the price further dropped to 999! Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they're good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose.

152,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.However, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG, Asphalt, COD, or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one, they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!

But I don't know which genius came up with the earbud designs. They hurt a lot! Unless you insert them deep in your ears you won't really be able to get them to stay on. Inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. Therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. A great pity.

171,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Overall:  Decent product, not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

174,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"First of all, for 999 it's the best.So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is 'decent'.You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires.

175,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

176,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Firstly the voice quality of the product is very nice compared to others at this range, however the service from boat side is not right. Mu product was damaged at the 7th day and I initiated the replacement option, the reverse pick up was scheduled however no delivery information is available still. Itz being 3 days now, when you go to boat website the tracking status button does not works on the website and even you cannot reach an representative via call. I don't know if I am gonna receive the product back or not!

177,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I used this headphone since 15th october ... today is 6th november ..build quality is great .. Styling is also great..I am getting 6-8 hours of battery backup with standby for 4 to 5 days... awasm battery backup..Coming  to sound quality,,, the punch of bass is just solid,, the midrange is also great,, high is little bit low,, but ok,, overall very very good sound quality... i was not accepting this type of sound quality ....also sound output is very loud...if u have a budget of 1.5k... just go for it.... u will be happy for sure.. and in this budget point,, there are no headphone that will compete this BOAT...A QUALITY PRODUCT FROM A QUALITY BRAND.....

178,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Writing after 1 months of rough use .Only get detached the rubber cap of charging point.Super compatible with my Samsung Grand 2 , Samsung M20 and Lenovo Lappy.Light weight.Super sound quality.  Same as JBL as I am JBL freak . Now a days JBL is giving bad cord for headphones... this one is good in 255.Only problem is the distance frequency is very very low.I purchased on Rs.999/- on sale.Better than other products as the round neck is not stiff so can listen while sleep too .Don't think too much just go for it .. not disappoint you .

179,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Very happy with the product. Been using it for last one month. Pairing in seconds. Sound quality is pretty good. I mostly use it for listening to music from Spotify/ Gaana. It comes with 3 different sizes of plug. I changed to small one which fits well in my ears. The legs are rubbery and very flexible so sits in the ear properly. Go for it!!

180,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

181,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Didnt fit my expectations,sound quality is good but battery backup is pathetic never lasted more than half an hour on 100 % charge,moreover the range too isnt good.doesnt work for running as the fitting isnt great .packaging too was pathetic it had dust inside the package.Stopped working within two weeks,wareanty isnt smooth too,jun 14 se complaint daali hai no response.wasted my money

182,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. The durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. Light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed).

183,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I like the product but some how when i open the parcel its box seal is broken. May be some one return the package and they gave me that broken seal package that i dont like, Thats is why i am giving 3 star otherwise product is good.

184,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Please don't buy this product. Only after using for 1 month earphones had stopped working and got it replaced within 15 days time. Now again I'm facing same issue with the replaced one.Had bought this earphones for jogging especially for jogging purpose however the keys don't work and I'm not sure of these are even sweat proof. Purchased in the month of March'19 now facing a lot of issues as to charging, battery life, Bluetooth connectivity, ear placement.

185,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I'm not happy that boat made these sub par headphones. They sound quality feels tinny. And the build quality was bad. The rubber casing came loose on one end after a month of use and i use it with the wire dangling out of the casing now. Not happy with this purchase. Then again, they didnt cost too much.

186,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The audio quality is just amazing!! Powerful bass and crystal clear audio. I haven't tested the battery's capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation.
",5
187,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.
",5
188,1,boAt Rockerz 255," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

Both the ear buds installed is for the right ear. So it is very difficult to fix the same on the left ear. Hope  this kind of issues will be taken care by BOAT's factory assembly line quality control team.

192,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Hi,This is a average quality headset. But in this price range I would say it is a good buy for sure.Pros:1. Very good battery backup. Last 6-7 hours on a average use.2. Build quality is good. Fit perfectly to the ears.3. Connects two device at a time. Connects easily.4. Less charging time.5. Very comfortable to wear.Cons:1. Sound quality is average. Don't expect much. You have to use equaliser otherwise no use.2. Call quality is not good. It could be better3. Connectivity issue if your mobile device is far from your headaet, even while your mobile device in pocket, sometime you will observe connectivity issue.Verdict- Well if you are a great music lover and if you are looking for a headset which has great sound quality than this is not a ideal device for you. However, if you want to use this device casually on a day to day basis like join meetings or gym etc than this a most value for money deviceThanks,Sourav

193,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Damaged Product and Packaging.Though this item was packed in another bigger carton box with air bubble cushioning and few other items, this particular item was damaged and the deal was open already.Thought, at least the product should do well, but the product failed to take charge and power up, which clearly indicated the product was a formerly returned item due to malfunction. Rather going to manufacturer warranty and repair/retirement this got resold.I've had many ear phones from BoAt and really love this brand (in the wireless category) alternating to House of Marley (in the wired category). But this one was shear disappointment.

194,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound Qualitywhomever used boat 225 in-ears headphones can understand better. If you have both 225 nd rockerz 255, you can compare the sound quality at the high volume and the clarity of songs. 225 was far better in that..And the guidelines are there only for how to switch on the Bluetooth and not clear for how to switch it off.DistanceIt was surely dislike for any one, if your mobile was in the next room then it was disconnecting again.ChargingDraining fast for continues usage, need to charge it more times. And it was not showing clearly indication of charging bar in mobile. Showing it rarely.Light IndicationIt was not clear at all. It is showing a mixed colours.MicWithout holding it you can't talk properly. It was a dear distance to use.And if you continuously keep them in ears it will be paining.Please never don't buy it from Appario seller. Better to buy from another seller. Even we can't return the product for lifetime..

195,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The headphones are justified for the price that they are available. I am using these since 15 days now and haven't noticed any major drawback, except that the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting if you are using it while on bike. Some modulations are noticed then. Also, after connecting to a laptop if tried  to connect to the cellphone it does not auto connect. Otherwise and sound quality is good for a normal usage. Battery life is also decent around 4-5 hours of constant use.

Connects with both PC and MOBILE very easily.Voice Acknowledgements are great in this Earphone. ( for  switch ON,  Switch OFF  &  Connectivity)There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.CONSAs it is a Bluetooth Earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile  or PC )While Commuting If the volume is too high, The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.Overall this product is great  . Whether you are using it for Voice or Video calls or listening to music (soft or high bass) or listening to any video lecture.

197,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Been 2 months since I bought it. The left side stopped working gradually and now the volume has became so low..Guess it’s better to opt for better branded products at similar price!There is literally no service centre in Bangalore for this product. Travelled like 13 kms to a place which looks more then a residential home then a service centre.. and only be told to register online as services are only done in Mumbai. Better not buy from Bangalore for convenience sake. 🙄

198,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I read most of the review's before buying this earphones and i ended up buying this amazing boat rockerzz, the sound clearity is okayish but oh man, the bass, it's amazing and the connectivity is brilliant, i walk from one room to another without taking my phone and it works flawlessly Without any glitch.The problem in most of the bluetooth earphone is you have to press and hold the power button for almost 3 second to turn it on and the same for turning it off or shuffling between songs which is annoying.Wire postioning is good but it can be better.The battery almost lasts for about 3 days if you use it fot 2 to 3 hours a day and the ear hooks are excellent for outdoor activities with this earphone.After all with my personal experience i can tell everyone that you can but this phone bluetooth earphone if you want good sound clearity, amazing bass, a decent battery life, and comfortable to use.

199,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

200,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have got this for rs.1419/- and for this range for the wireless headphone it is a good deal, sound is ok and comfortable to use, it did not fall from ear, as there is some locking type of thing, which holds the earpiece in it's place, nice product. It may feel this way because i used to airpod from apple.

201,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product.

Due to extreme Bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. At full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.But there is a solution to the problem, you can install '' Black player'', which has tones of equaliser settings.So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! 😃

I love them totally & am using from past few years.This wireless in-ear headsets doesn't have the richness in bass. May be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.Except for this one drawback, this product is bang for the bucks you pay. It's lightweight, comfortable, long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.If you're okay with decent bass, this is for you.Apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests.

205,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It is an awesome, I really like it cause the sound quality. And the most important thing is that it won't trouble your ears if you wear it for a long as I tried most of the headphones, wireless Bluetooths most of them troubles me a lot if I put them into or on my ears for a long like 1 to 2 hrs. But this one is really awesome, the bass is superb, it won't fall down from your ears while running... Amazing product. Boat rocker 255 is really rocking as the name..... If I want to rate it so definitely it will be 5/5

206,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"In terms of sound quality, it is good. But this earphone is not for sports activity. The cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.Range is not even 5 meters. As soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.Bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.Wire is way to long. Around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. I have given the image. I am 5.4. The earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.Overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise.

208,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling, on the first day, I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I'm able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn't like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation, very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly, background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they're getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don't write reviews for anything, whether it's good or bad. But if I don't write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There's is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues.

However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money.

225,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have purchased the product on 7 Dec 2018 stopped working In Feb 2019, Reported it to boat, as per amazon, after a trial of email, the executive does not answer the call who was supposed to pick the product and drops a text that ""NO I AM NOT COMING"". I am left with faulty headphones now. What am I supposed to do with it.

226,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound is average not that good as compared to JBL and some other great brands. The bass is more but treble is less. If u travel on a bike or cycle and wind is blowing at a higher speed then there is lag in Bluetooth connection. Overall good at the price of 999. If you want great quality sound go for JBL or boult or Bose.

227,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it's not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

228,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Hi all,This headphone I have purchased to replace my 'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic' headphone with lot of expectations from the Boat. But the sound quality of 'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic is much better than the Boat.But the physical quality of Boat is awesome. If u are looking for the best sound quality please dont go for it and if u are looking for the physical quality, Boat is the best under Rs.1,500/-Headphone Quality - ****Sound Quality - **Base - **Battery durability - *** (5Hrs)Value for money - ***Over All I can give THREE STARS for this product

232,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"First impression is good. Sound quality is good. But the grip to hold earphones around your neck is quite light. Sometimes it gets fly away when you are driving. Battery life is good but after using it for 9 days i felt that when the battery is 60% and suddenly it gets down to 20 so fast and recently i was at 60% and suddenly the earphones gets off. After i got replacement, the new product seems to work very nice regarding the battery life but the noise cancellation was damn bad like you can't listen to the music while driving because the noise of the wind is too loud you cant even talk.. and hence i had to return the product..

233,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Hi,Good sound quality at this price range.  I am using it just recently and has already noticed that build is not so good,  one of the biggest flaws actually. Second problem I faced is that the wire is too long,  hence lookwise it looks bit shabby and also it keeps calling from the ear.  Here again the earbuds design not so good to add it to the easily falling off from the ear. Who likes it!  Apart from this boat always provides satisfactory listening experience at cheaper rates. I would love to see it working even after one year even after so many build flaws,  after all if the product is rough and tough at affordable rates,  all this flaws can be ignored.Thanks!

234,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Absolutely poor quality sound, very low volume, lousy bass. I would have even ignored the sound but for the fact that the earphones just don't fit properly. Even with all the options given. These are only suitable for walking at a leisurely pace for those who are on a very tight budget. NOT recommended for running or jogging as the earbuds will keep popping out. I  returned the originals once thinking I had a defective piece but the replacement too had the same issue. Spend a little more and buy something better.

243,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it's the best one in this price segment. Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass, it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up, i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it.

While plugin to charge when its 0%, it started showing 100% charged in 15 minutes, that's a CRAP.I have now returned the product back to the seller and call for a replacement.

Generally , I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it.

The built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected

Don't know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range.  Battery backup is around 4-5 hours. But will drain your phone's battery really fast.

I purchased it in 1199/- in sale (these sales are just selling gimmick,I knew BoAt is just a branding on chinese stuffs like micromax, they can sell their item only on e plateform, still I thought to give it a try.

293,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Worthless product distorted sound, nice basss, fatela avaj, battery life was good at starting but after some days you need to recharge battery regular, when battery percentage was 60% or below it's behave like 0% and you need to recharge it, also sounds not good the coming from that little hole is like totally distorted.

294,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Quality is great, the cord is longer than normal and headphones have held up for months of hard use at gym, running etc. with no damage whatsoeverSound is warm and full, the highs are not annoying and the bass isn't overemphasized which allows you to listen to them over extended periods of time. Probably the best sounding pair of in ear headphones I've ever owned

297,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Hello People,Earphones provides good sound and bass. Although it not worth to have Bluetooth earphone with battery drain issues and Bluetooth range is 1-2m.I find earphone giving issues and glitches in connections in calls and sound after 2 meters.Also Battery is below average with 2-3 hours max capacity.Best of all is Amazon does not provide return on this product, only exchange option is availble.Think twice before buying this product.

298,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Based on usage so far I have very few complaints. The buttons that are programmed for volume, can't be programmed for media changer. And that there is no caller id in the earphones, but apart from these I love the product. Yes the sound quality or noise cancellation is not as great as airpods or high end earphones, which is obvious given the cost of the product. But for the price, the product is great.

299,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"worst of product weast of money,  i have purchased this hear phones 5 months back now both the speakers not working. i had raised the ticket for the same but no use.. several times i am trying to reach out custumer support not answered.Finally i realised that purchasing this kind of products weast of money and time spending to order this.

300,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I used this product for like 6 months. In between one side of its earphone stopped working but boat team is too responsive as they replaced this product with new one. Sound quality is good but if you want better quality would recommend for other product. Battery life is best even using for so much of time. But facing difficulties as there always some kind of issue happening again and again. Other then its fine if it is bought under sale.

302,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Overall the product is perfectly fine from bass, terrible, noise cancellation, battery everything is up to mark. Boat is providing the best ever music quality and it's for sure a product that can be purchased with close eyes.Cons**Amazon packing is worst, I have got the product with open sealed,  I was thinking about the return but though product was running alright I changed my mind to keep it so.**No casing, sometimes it became hard to keep them apart from wearing.

303,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Good but keeps disconnecting sometimes when the phone is in my pocket. Also option to navigate through the songs is limited. Also not sure if the product delivered was a 2nd hand one judging by the package condition. I think better to buy from shop after inspection of seal and every thing.

305,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I did not like the sound of the device too much (bass is not too much as the other reviews claim).  Mine had problems connecting to multiple devices,  I had to switch it off and then switch it on everytime I want some it to connect to multiple devices. Battery backup is only about 5 hours

306,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It's really a good earphone. Amazon provided a great delivery, I got my product just on the next day of ordering it. I bought it for 1099 during the sales and I must say it is the best wireless earphone I have used. The functions,  Battery life,  audio quality everything is just awesome.Ione drawback is that, boat is supposed to provide a carrying case with it.  It's really risky to put it in the bag or somewhere else.  Otherwise it's the best product.

307,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Bluetooth connectivity issues always i need boat company is not doing properly QA testing . All boat product is used to damaged very soon and thay dont have service centre as well on Bangalore

308,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"If only this the Bluetooth range was little better this would have been an excellent product.I use thus headphone while running. When I kept my phone on zipped pocket on the back of my track I would often loose connectivity. I had to keep my phone either on my hand or front pocket which was quite inconvenient. I returned the first one but still same problem withbthe second one.I also wish they’d provide a case for safekeeping.

309,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is good but there's lot of disturbance while playing music. Sounds like  music is buffering due to slow internet connection even though I am playing tracks which are saved in my phone. When they are saying it's has Qualcomm technology for better connectivity then I don't expect this.Another issue is battery drains too fast. If I charge fully in the morning then I need to charge in the afternoon coz it's switched off.I have given the 2 stars for the sound quality only otherwise it's not much worth.

310,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Review after 4 months of usage.Life of this product is of 3-4 months,its not durable or reliable.One side becomes non-functional.The after service is the worst from Boat.There is no service center and there is no one to respond on callsYou may log a ticket with boat but there won't be any resolution for a month and no one will respond to your query.If you don't get frustrated with above things and are ready to pay more than 1000 bucks for this.. then God Bless U

314,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Connection issues is my main problem. Phone is in pocket and sound breaks up. And lag is awful in PUBG you stop walking and sound is like good second or two behind. Amazing sound quality for price. Comfortable built quality is not bad. That’s why I gave 3 stars. I am going to use it for music mainly so I am keeping it, but if you are planning to use it for gaming don’t but it. I wouldn’t recommend this. If you are using it for anything but music.

315,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"If u think of some bad product's I've got. This is one of the top ones. Got the new one which died a week after the return date passed. Sent it for repair and got the replacement after 4 weeks which worked for less than a week.  Sent it back again and got it after 4 weeks which worked a little more this time and lasted for 3-4 weeks and the battery is gone again. The battery doesn't last for more than 30 min no matter what I do. Charged it for a few mins and hours and neither made a difference

Only problem is you will experience little ear pain if you put on the ear bud continuously more then an hrs time.

Noice cancellation is pretty good tooCons:1. Sometimes Bluetooth connectivity fluctuates and it disconnects/reconnects automatically2. Cannot wear while Jogging unless you find a way to stick them to one place. While running it tends to bounce off and eventually drops off from your ears

322,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"writing after using it for more than 4 months.At first lil disappointed due toh connectivity issue, many times it gets disturbance I believe could be bcos of frequency overlapping. But I want to talk about today's experience I am traveling for around 8 hrs now its incredibly working awsm, no battery issues, no connectivity issues, still 60% battery remains. I think its bcos of short distance range.Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now.

323,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is great in this price range. Built in plastuic. Looks a little fragile but does the job in Rs. 999. You need to take a little care of them. Fitting in ear is a little problem in initial days but your ears will adjust with it. Bass is above average which is rare in bluetooth earphones.

324,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn't much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.

325,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Bluetooth connection stability this device connects instantly but while jogging working out or on the move sometimes there is audio delay interruption which is unpredictable sometimes. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome but if you want to enjoy music on the move or jogging etc this device will dissappoint you.The battery% fluctuated.. It means at the time connection battery level was 50/60% after using it for 15/20 min in medium volume the battery gets down ivr response battery low and indicator goes totally red.

326,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I purchased two wireless earphones simultaneously, Boat RockerZ 255 and MI basic wireless earphones. After using both for a week, I found that:1. Boat RockerZ 255 is comparatively higher on bass and sound quality.2. MI has a better battery longevity.3. Boat RockerZ has a more sturdy built.4. MI is easier and much lighter to move around with.I use either as per my need.

327,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Pro's - Packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery.  Cons - Extremely bloated bass which makes it hard to listen to music to, poor mic which attracts complaint of poor sound quality while using phone/skype. These headphones are useful for sports/workout only.  Not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic.

328,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The earphone is fine. The wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. The wire at the neck is way too thick. Seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. I do not like it for that reason. It will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.Dound quality is good. However, the bluetooth range is not so good. It starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another.

329,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"sound quality: heavy bass, the vocals and instrumentals are a little drowned out by this. But I prefer heavy bass for workouts.build: build is pretty good and flexible.  it has a frame which goes around the neck, this can be kind of annoying when running or jumping, but i just tuck it underneath my shirt.  the eartips havent fallen out yet, they are a great fit.function: just a reminder that to change tracks u have to hold down volume up and down keys, double tapping middle button actually calls the previous person you called.

330,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"First things firstHeadphone is very good...Connenctivity is awesome...Connects two devices simultaneously...

Bcoz they couldn't listen my voice properly....So consider this before.. overall ok..

336,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I was hoping for great BASS which is not easily found in most low to medium budget headphones, but disappointed with it :-( Sound clarity is excellent, but output is so sharp & piercing that it could damage your hearing if you do NOT remember to reduce the volume by at least 2 points before plugging in! Over all, it is okay for the price but I already have an over-the-ear Bluetooth headset from boAt that I love and hence expected similar sound quality.

337,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have tried few other wireless earphones but beats coming from this one is great. It gives a good balanced sound and it is so comfortable that it can be used for long duration. Battery life is also good, battery is easily giving 5 6 hrs of backup. I only found one thing that can be better that it takes a while to charge the battery completely, 1.5/2 hrs for charging.I have Boats wireless speaker also and that piece is also nice.Go for it.

339,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Listening to Music:The sound quality of the earphones is good. The bass sounds are slightly over boosted; which may annoy some of the listeners. Bass lovers can buy without hesitation.Connecting Calls:The call quality is disappointing. The inbuilt mic is not that great. The other person's voice that we hear during a call is also slightly distorted when compared with making a call without Bluetooth earphones.Over all build quality is good.

340,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Ill give you honest review about this earphone. Excellent performance. Battery life very good. You can use whole day. I ordered 3 at a time from myntra at 900rs. That's was a very amazing offer on it. 2 connection works perfectly. But sometimess it gets auto disconnect but again it gets connected. But this is a case of one of my earphone, not with every earphone. I have all three colours. I'llI recommend you to buy this, as at this price you will not find any better earphone. Overall value for money.

As it takes into consideration your body deflection ,and sound of a person talking is like he is in water.battery life is good.sound quality is better as i grabbed it for discount at 1200/₹.Actually would give 3.5 🌟

368,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I like the overall sound quality of the product, just that you have to push to buttons for a few good seconds to power on or off or change to a next track. And that's not too comfy when you're on a treadmill

369,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound coming off these seem imbalanced. The vocals seem to be in the background and the instruments in the foreground. Also can't run or jog wearing these as the part with the buttons keep hitting your collar bone.

371,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Very bad product, i wqs fan of boat till i bought this ear phones, i bought two of these ans within 3 months one sidded stopped working of both earphones. I sent for replacement from official sites and they send me msg after 10 months that some guy from courier company will pick up fauly earphones but no one is coming since 10 days after msg, i am continuously calling that xpressbess guy but he answring like i will come this time and that time but he never comes. Worst product, worst service Dont buy.

372,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound Quality : The sound quality is very good... Good baas... At higher volume the bass tends to overpower the vocals but at this price point the audio quality is very good.Battery life : takes around two hours to charge completely. I do not use it continuesly but it can give you around 6 hours of music playback and talk time included.Durability : around the neck design allows the earphone to be used freely... making it tangled free... durability of the wire is also very good.

373,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Got it for 999 during a flash sale.The left earphone stopped working properly within a week. Got it replaced.. Thanks to amazon.The replacement is even worse. The battery dies down within 2 hrs of usage. And to top it off, the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isn't covered under warranty. Even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week, the answer is same.So just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be.

374,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It was going exactly so good untill three days.It showed low battery and plugged it in to the charger and since then it is not working.I did not expect this from ""AMAZON"" neither from ""BOAT""The worst part is have misplaced the recieptamd neither do I have the box in which it came..How do I reclaim my headphones.It was excellent the sound quality was very good but the issue which I faved,I never expected this from this company of such high stature.Amazon please look into this matter

375,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This is my 2nd purchase and it works as advertise. For the price this is best what one can get. Good bass, don't ask for low as it's just a decent wireless sport earphones. good fit, has some extra pair ear buds.

376,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality of the earphone is good. The base and the noise cancellation is commentable. But I am not Satisfied with the products durability, just usage of 6 months and one side of it is not working. I really am a BOAT fan, but this product didn't survive as per it's name and money. You will find better earphones in same price range or you may have to Shell out a little bit more. Overall rating is just above average for this earphones just because of the durability.

377,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Pros: Excellent sound quality for this price.. I would have not returned it, if it had continued to work well.Cons :  Stopped working 15 days from the date of purchase. Also, my phone had to be almost near the headphone for it to work well.

378,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sounds quality is very nice...it has a good bass and the build quality is also nice considering it's price but the range of connection is very poor... Even if it is very close to the device the music gets cut a little which is annoying sometimesEdit: I exchanged the one I received with a new boat rockerz 255 and this one has no issues. The one I received earlier was defective...Changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars😃😃

379,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is very good more than expected from a 1499 earbuds. After a long time enjoyed music. Bass is ultimate. Call quality is very good indoors. Didn't test it outdoors yet. I watched lots of best bluetooth devices video reviews and this one is listed in top 3. Hence considered buying it and it has turned out to be a good decision. Happy with it. Will test it more and update. Hope it will give a good battery life. 110 mah should last long

380,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The product is good for the price i paid 999.but i have a doubt whether its an original boat earphones.cuz the brand mark is nowhere engraved.just printed on the band.and its a long than expected..And Guys the battery backup is just 2-2.5hrs
",4
381,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It's noise cancellation isn't very effective. U need to speak loudly for other party to hear your voice. Also, battery goes straight from 100 to 80% and theb to 60% in no time. After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. Good in terms of bass and sound quality. Overall it's an average product with lots of advertisement and marketing.

382,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I like the whole package(build quality, packaging, earbuds ,light weight, super comfy) the battery is good..it's all comes to the sound quality....for a Rs1200-1500 earphone it's too low....it's all bass...nothing but bass...nobody wants that much bass..used loads of other earphones..sound is too bassy...otherwise descent product
",5
383,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The product is super but it is not robust. The earphones does not last long. I bought it on Sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. The customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. Again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. Sound quality is awesome. One cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver.
",4
384,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality takes a big hit. I play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques, and I enjoy listening to music. Both of them were affected by the use of these. Also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use
",3
385,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.Overall, it is a must buy and good to have.
",5
386,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.When we r driving the band behind the neck  is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can't use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not
",4
387,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I'd say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I'm having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns.

388,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Merits:-1. Been using it for last 2 weeks. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are  using it continually.4. Sweat proof is also awesome,  Very flexible,  weightless. Demerit:-1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music.

393,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality is fine, the bass is also okay. They are very light, so if you use them while running or working out you don't even feel them. The battery life is also good. Most importantly if you work out or run then you don't have to constantly worry about the wire being pulled. So for ₹999 these are a good catch.

While taking a call, the other person keeps complaining that my voice is echoing. I like to use earphones while taking a call, so half the utility of these is lost.

398,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound has more of bass and very little treble effect. If you like to listen to your music with slightly higher setting of treble, you will be disappointed. Battery is very good and so is noise cancellation. It's quite big and sturdy though, will not go unnoticed.

Tridled with few different phones to make sure no compatibility issue, but all time connectivity issue. For this high price, not upto mark. Box packing was used. Seems like supplier keep rotating faulty used item.

402,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The best part about this headphone is its sound quality, immersive and deep, way better than some of the more famous brands in this price range.However, there are no other major features in the headphone, and it is a bit clunky (not user friendly) to use.But if you just want to pay for the sound quality and not the frills, then this is an exceptionally good headphone

403,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"As I get these for jus Rs. 999, the sound quality is great for me in this price range with wireless connectivity.It gives me more then 6 hours of battery backup on every full charge ( got discharged in between 6-7.5 hours depending on my usage).I m happy that I bought it. 😊

404,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is average. Bass is below average... horrible experience using this. After 2hrs of usage ears starting paining... Bluetooth range is around 5ft only after that it fluctuate. Noise cancelling is good. Wires are bit longer so it looks ridiculous. and on using this earphone on above medium level of volume it lasts for around 3 hrs only... Overall please don't buy it go for other options with lighter weights of earphones.

407,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Quality is not upto the mark. Instead you can just go with JBL wireless. It is just 300 rupees more than boat or you can opt for JBL wired which is just 800 bucks and way more worth than boat. Too much noise in the background. It even got replaced once but no use. Now they have only replace option and no refunds. Waste product. Don't even like it. It's just fallen in my drawer everyday and I don't feel like using it at all.  DO NOT EVER BUY BOAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY.

410,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Quality is very good in this price range. Bass is superb. I mostly use it for workouts. It does the job well. I face problem about noise cancellation as the other person on phone always complaints about unnecessary sounds from the sorroundings when I take a call outdoor. Service delivery from boat is amazing and satisfactory. They replaced my headphones after 3 months as one of the buds started sounding low.

411,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that's why one can't experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. Battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. But due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. The summer u can think....Its a nice purchase for listening music but some  designing faults i can see that's it.

The sweat doesnt affect the device.There are some issues with the product. You can hear some disturbance many times. Bluetooth connectivity range is around 5metres only.Overall a nice product at this price range. You can go for it if you are in a tight budget and also want a branded product.

419,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Whenever i call somebody then the ring sounds very poor. It feels like watef is there inside the soeaker of headphone/earphone. It creates too much irritation. Along with this i couldn't experience any noice cancellation/reduction feature in this because during call (the people with whom i was talking), they were saying some disturbance from your side and the same I was feeling. So overall for listening music its good but for calling purpose its not a nice product to buy.Thanks

420,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Basic wireless headset with mic. Sound quality is average. Had expected good bass as its from boat.. but was disappointed with the bass as well as the sound quality which sounded artificial. Batter backup is good and also the make quality is good.  A 3 star product.

422,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought this in amazon sell with sbi card in 900 rs. First, the bass of sound is very good.noise cancellation is good.  All other features like buildup quality, ear fitting, etc are above average. Not bed but don't compare with costly one. Finally one line- good one batter then all other brands up-to 2000-3000. Value for money if you buy up-to 1000-1100.

423,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price.

429,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.

430,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality is good, stays firmly on the ear and battery life is decent. But, the turning on and off and battery low notification with voice is very annoying. The battery notification that appears on the phone jumps in large increments and is unreliable. Also this is unusable while running or riding as the audio gets distorted a bit under shaky situations which is I guess is the biggest flaw.

432,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The product has decent build quality which makes it durable. However the cable is too long which makes it look a little weird hanging around your ears. Battery drains quickly.

450,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound is good, Noise cancellation is good, some very rare time the other side of person is unable to hear my voice which may b due to my mobile network not sure. One thing designwise i wanna mention here which i little feel uncomfortable is the size of the earpiece which bulges out so much tat when wearing Helmet it gves a lot of pressure inside the ears from the helmet and it becomes air tight 😐 If Boat can make it little sleak or small in size!!

451,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Nice product at a price of 999. Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Only problem I have noticed is that whenever it goes out of my Mobile's range, even for 2 seconds, it doesn't get connected automatically and I have to connect it manually again. Rest all looks ok.I am using it for 3 days now and battery life, call quality etc is satisfactory.Can't comment on durability at this stage.

453,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Best headphone for this price range mids, bass and treble are at good tuning. Bass is a bit Punching which is nice for bass heads.

455,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Please read it before you buying1. Sound quality is good but not loud enough2. Battery is good3. Bluetooth connectivity is good4. Wire is too longBut the main part, it is a headphone and you should put it on your ear, but believe me after using 10 min you feel pain in ear, frequently it fall from ear, it is not light weight so it irritating your ear and head. So please buy a light weight headphone to do the main job.

Its very frustrating to switch back to earpiece mode and listen again

476,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have had a very bad experience with these. A month after using these the left ear bud started distorting and the volume control started heating up. I had written a complaint and they were exchanged within 15 days. Yes, they have really good customer service.

479,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Everything else is great but the major issue with this earphone is its very hard for ears and your ears will start paining within 30 mins of usage and i also tried all 3 earbuds which come from company but still the same issue. Also there's no refund policy from Boat only replacement will be given. So don't buy as I'm regretting my decision.

484,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"After using it for 3 weeks I'm giving this review.. i bought it for 1200.. Sound quality is good with more bass.. if u don't want that much bass means u can change the hear bud to a smaller one.. Quality of the product is also good i guess it will be a durable one.. Battery life is ultimate.. If u use it for 3 hrs a day it will last for 1 week.. Since I'm using it for my gym I feel very comfortable with this battery life..

485,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"These earphones are awesome and there is no trouble with them. Those who are saying that they don't have bass are wrong i have used them and the bass is seriously pretty strong for wireless earphones in such a price range. They are not over priced as well. Moreover while talking over them the person on the other side also didn't face any difficulty hearing me. These earphones are great, I personally highly recommend these.

486,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I have heard better sounding headsets and was honestly a bit disappointed for the quantity of sound. The mids and lows are not up to the mark. It's good for voice only application.

487,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I listened to the songs when I plugged the charging chord, i couldn't believe the awesome quality sound it gave me. I discovered fault after exactly 15 minutes of unboxing it. The battery is faulty. Only works when power chord is connected. Filed for return and replacement exactly 1 hour after reciving it. Giving only 3 stars due to faulty product. When it comes to sound quality nothing can beat this earphone.

494,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I'm giving 4 stars as overall because the product is all good but the packaging wasn't satisfactory. The box was bit damaged fortunately the product wasn't damaged. Sond quality is above average but the better thing in such price is IPx5 sweat resistant. Noise cancellation is good too.So try to order this separately for better packaging service rather than adding to your cart and buying more than one product.

538,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Though the sound and battery life is worth buying this product, in one months time the left earplug stopped working without any reason. There was no rough handling neither any connection to water, while listening to the music I realized that there is no sound from left speaker and I dont know what to do or where to go for servicing/checking. So guys, if you wish to buy, rethink and then spend.

539,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Wanna tell u when I bought it for first time. It was the best then any of the headset I have ever used. And after that I ordered two more. But they where the fake or was not that good. Sound was too bad and the Bluetooth chip set was different from the first I ordered. I can say they where not original. So I replaced them and again I got the fake one so I finally returned them.

Worst product seriously. : (

637,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I've been using the product once in a while when I go out to jog and every it does a good job at holding in my ears and providing an acceptable quality of sound and novel sound cancellation with no issues of sweatBut none of that feels perfect but just enough to bear with it for a couple of hoursIt's a good ""product for the price""

643,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality is good,noise cancellation works perfectly. Bluetooth connection works fine, the wires could have been a little shorter. Battery also works fine, the only thing is when indicator is shown for low battery (20%) it drains within minutes.

650,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Ah the thing is, i bought this earphones for morning running but you still need to develop it. It fits good when you are walking but while running mostly it doesnt keep balance and fell off. Do more design like samsung level U earphones where weight is added so they wont fell off and some need some fitting arangement in shape to fit properly in ear.

659,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Was interested because I bought their sound bar which was sensational. However, I'm quite disappointed with the sound quality. It lacks bass.That being said, if my expectations weren't that high based on my previous experience, it would be a decent choice.

679,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Everything is really good at such price range Cons:1. Battery indication is not perfect. Its shows level of 100,80,60,20. So before you know, you might run out of battery.2. Sound reception of mouth piece is not perfect. Surrounding noise is heard more prominantly at far end rather than speaker's voice

680,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Its been a month now... First of all its a neckband wireless in the ear headphone.. The sound is more like boat basshead 255..i have used 255 earlier.. Battery backup is probably 5-6 hours.. i got it in sale at 990.. And at this cost Its worth it...

685,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is good but the volume compared to the boat rockerz450 is way better.. Since its a in -ear headphone boad could have worked on it a little more..

686,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This is very simple earphones. No stereo sounds no Eco sound no deep base bass as well as not much more Cristal sound. If this earphones rate has 500rs then it will be good.

690,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"What an item it is!! Must say, the sound quality, the design, specially the bass effect is just perfect.

691,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Honestly speaking sound quality is not as expected, bass is good but rest all not so great,Battery is not bad I get 6-7 hoursDurability is good,Connectivity is not good, regular disconnection happens while you move few meters or while traveling which is not expected.Overall I would rate this below 4

694,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Good earphone for sound quality but there is Bluetooth range problem , in specifications boat says 10m range but actually this earphone has range upto only 3m, when battery is below 50% it's Bluetooth range is only 1m, Also battery backup is very poor

",5
696,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"To me this headset is worthless. Simple reason that the basic noise cancellation is absent and one can't use these to talk. The other person would complain or hear more of background noise than my own. If a product ignores such a basic feature means its not worth a penny

697,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This one is the best bluetooth earphones you can get at this price range. However I'm disappointed that it states on website as dual pairing but it does not. Can someone from boat check the same.

699,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought these about 15 days back. The sound quality isn't all that great, great bass and average noise cancellation.

I had high hopes from this purchase but sadly, boAt let me down with this.

700,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Well excellent sound quality and provides good noise cancellation .. but when the controller catches the sweat the buttons do not function properly.It's just a month and this has happened twice now so if these people are mentioning that sport earphones they pls don't fall for that.. its just useful for normal and just be thoughtful.
",2
701,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Product is ok. Sound mids and lows are ok. Sound gets diatracts if u increase volume above 70% . I found geekcases Status bluetooth headsets better than this bcoz it has Aptx sound technology in it which boat rockerz does not have.

702,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"T'he product is not as per my expectations, it got disconnect automatically in between (though it has enough battery life) and you have to establish the connection again.

723,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"During the call, the other side people will not hear you properly you have to lift the mic and hold it till the time you're speaking. also there is no direct contact between PH and headphone so you can't play the FM. Rest is all gud. Sound quality is better.

I did read about the same in one ef the reviews but didn't expect it to happen so soon. Sounds and build quality is good

742,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Not worth Rs.1699 that I paid. Sound quality is no better than others available at much lower price. Not useful for workout as well as it tends to fall off.

743,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This is a really great feeling after getting perfect hands-free Bluetooth. It has likely 6 to 7 hr of Battery life when listening songs or having calls. Comfortable after 2 3 hrs of continuous usage. Fits in the ear nicely. 100% value for money product.

745,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Got it for 999 and all I could say is best in it's class. Sound quality is good and the bass too. Some people may feel small pain in ear after continues use as in my case but manageable. Battery backup is very good and gets charged rapidly. Overall worth to go without much research

750,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is good but the mic is pathetic. Leaving your own voice the mic would catch everything else. So I won't recommend this earphones for taking the calls.

789,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Good earphones for those who loves bass! But the drawback is that it doesn't have clear clarity of treble. It has less clarity and more bass! And so according to this feature the cost 1,699/- is bit more. But you get a good battery backup and good built quality.

857,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I purchased this product on 24.4.19. And it is not working today. I am jot able to connect it to any of my devices. It was working fine initially. Bit since last few days i am not able to connect it with my phone. I tried with other 4 different phones but i am not able to connect it.

858,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"An awesome product. The day I put it in the ear, I was spellbound. The bass is good, the treble is good and the sound is crisp and clear. I am lucky that I picked it up at Rs.999. Loving it wearing around the neck all the time and I am now 60.
",5
859,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It is a problem with battery indicator.Battery indicator on mobile shows 100% or 80% only. Even if the battery is 50% or even less it still reflects 80% and so on. So it does not reflect the exact batterylevel.

860,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I didnt like the product. Noise cancellation is zero. The person couldnt hear my voice rather he/ she is able to hear the voices in my background. And its been a month product start losing its colour. I wish i could return it back.. if you can take it back please take it

861,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The product is great. The sound quality is excellent. The bass is superb. Noise cancellation is perfect.Battery is powerful last 4-5 hrs with one charge.One thing I must say the cable is way too long.The product I received  and the delivery service is mind blowing.

862,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Brought during Amazon festival sale for ₹1099. Sound clarity could have been much better at mid to higher volume. Good battery life along with the build quality.

866,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Good sound quality but equally uncomfortable, one will have to struggle to fit it, in the ear .It sipped charging and working in 10 days.
",1
867,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The earphones stopped working in less than 2 months. It does not charge, switch on or pair with any device. While I did not expect top-grade sound/build quality at this price point (and the sound was very average), I had at least expected it to work for more than a month.
",1
868,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"A good purchase for this price. However, the bluetooth range is max upto 7 to 10 metres only. Sound quality is good and is sweatproof to a good extent. Battery life is just okay, not great. Little flaws here and there but one of my best purchases.

871,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The bass is very good in Boat Rockerz 225 and sound is also good . But the battery is okay and should improve on build quality .

872,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is very good as always Boat have, Super bass with balanced treble. Within this price range no other can beat boat. Go for it.My 1st product has less treble and i replace that product and this is as expected. If you think sound is not upto the mark then replace your product.

873,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I am happy to review sound quality is very nice but one problem is that you can't hear sound more than 20 minutes because of air bud quality it so bad

875,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality is nice, but it's built quality is worst, my friend bought this headphone which he have to sent to service center twice, and mine one started showing problem within 1month, the song automatically restarts and it gets changed by it's own.

879,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I think they are not durable or maybe I received a detected product and the wire starts to come out in just 2,3 hours or use.Amazon will give a new one.. Lets see how they will perform and will be.

880,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The device starts malfunctioning after some seconds. Dont understand whether its the product itself or just one in a peice. Sometimes the product does not switch on. Not a great product to go for.

881,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"its a good product ,but after one month one ear side is not working,after buying a quality product again we facing a problem ,y we have to buy & pouring 1500rs for this products,waste

882,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Product quality is good , bass is very nice.Little uncomfortable in ears specially while gymming with lot of sweat.Neck Band little annoying while doing extensive workouts .Otherwise sound quality is goodWill give 4/5 stars overall

",4
884,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Good enough but sound is low as compared with other.
",4
885,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"For the price point this lives up the expectation but you expect more battery backup from neck band earphones , this gives you roughly 3.5 to 4 hours of usages . Noise cancellation is not effective , people keep on complaining while on call . Build quality is good .
",3
886,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Very good sound quality, value for money, good base, noise cancellation is also good, built quality is also good
",5
887,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound is good but if you hate bass than this is not right ... It has extremely high bass .. noise cancellation is perfect... And the quality is absolutely premium.
",5
888,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Review after 45 days of usage : battery drops to 20% directly from 60%, works for 5 more minutes after that and turns off because battery is completely drained out. if you put on charge and connect, suddenly battery percentage jumps to 60%.other than battery, everything else is good.
",2
889,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Noise cancellation is good, and sound quality is good as well, even in calls. But, bass is poor. And battery lasts 3-4 hours max. Have to charge it daily. So if you want good quality earphone for movies and calls go for it and if you want it for bass and good battery life, don't go for it.
",3
890,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Dont how does it works with other phones but with honour pro i used to get headache whenever i use it...
",1
891,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"First one i order had connectivity issues so i order a replacement...look at the pictures of replacement product... package looks tampered or used..and the earphones were dirty also

893,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Very Happy with the product. Sound quality is above average. Battery life is very good. We don't feel like it's present around your neck. Light weight yet durable. Sits comfortable in my ears. Overall satisfied with my new wireless earphones.

894,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Very bad experience..i had heard good things about boat earphones..about soubd quality and durability..but my new earphones wont even start..i have not used it even for a day..it turns on only when its on charge..otherwise it wont even start after charging for a whole day..i want my money
",1
895,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is best in this price range and Bluetooth connectivity is surprisingly good only problem is battery life it is kinda low means you can easily get, 5 hours of usage in one charge but that's not enough anyways I guess that what you get in this price range.
",4
896,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality is fare with its price.Bluetooth earphone from boat at this cheap price it's unexpected.if you want this for music then it's OK.But when watching movie or some lectures then it's sound is low.Overall this earphone is good. Overall rating is 4/5
",5
897,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Very good Bluetooth earphones with excellent sound and built quality. Battery life is also good. One thing to notice is that the wire is bit long to my liking. Totally satisfied with my purchase.
",5
898,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Not satisfied with the product. Sound quality is not at all good. I bought these because these were in my budget. Go for a better brand if you want to have a long term durability. Or, buy it at discount. I don't feel they are worth it for Rs.1500
",3
899,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Durability is really good, flexible and doesn't fall off ears that easy, although the rubber material used for the eargrip isn't that great and is the only con (for which I have given a star less). Also for the price it's available, one can't really complain about battery. Which is 6hrs.
",4
900,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality bass good but one side stopped working sound is getting lower day by day no service station number is working as they shows on you tube or warrany card..verybad boat befooling indian people
",1
901,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Nice fit and finish. Quick pairing with phone. The range is about 10ft max, but works well. Haven't used much to comment on battery life. Sound is good if you are into bass, I prefer neutral sound image.
",5
902,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"So I like everything about this bluetooth. It's battery life, sound, range of connectivity. But when I talk to people on call they could hear the voice of my surrounding clearly but couldn't hear my voice. So basically even if it says notice cancellation but it doesn't work.
",4
903,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought these earphones in the third week of January 2019. They worked great for more than 5 months and now they have stopped working from 1st July, 2019. I was just listening to songs and a weird sound 'chhuchik' came from right earphone and it is not turning on from then.
",3
904,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Ok.. in that price... Not much battery backup .For me feels like the ear things not fit so fine.. I have to get used to of it.. it's not quite comfortable.

909,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality very good. Battery life could be better to make it perfect. Also the length of wire could be reduced/adjustable. Currently too long
",4
910,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Please do not buy it .... I bought and the problem started after 15 days .. Battery is weak .. adjustable buttons skips the song on its own after playing it for 15 seconds ... You can get  repair only through official site .. they repaired it thrice still problem continues such a waste
",1
911,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Worst earphones ever. The funny part is whenever you try to listen a music of good quality with awesome bass the intention of these heaadpones is the make that music unbearable. I wish the brand would have endorsed in technology and quality rather then marketing and actors endorsement.
",2
912,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound should be louder with bass. Clarity is good but what I thought this product is not louder (fadu)
",3
913,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Carry case was not included in the package.. however, the sound quality is very good with a strong bass. Battery charging takes unusually long time. Overall, satisfied with the product.

914,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Sound quality Awesome, Battery life is very good but auto connection problem we have to connect manually otherwise no problem at all.  If you want to buy then you can buy it.

",5
918,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"The sound quality is just wow. It stays in ear preety well. I didn't notice any falling off from ear during running. It has flat cable ,but built quality of the cable seemed low. For 999 it is super value for money.

927,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"I bought these few days back but not stands for the money which I paid 😅. Sometimes Bluetooth got disconnected and battary goes down at once.Well I would suggest to buy JBL or Sony instead of these because Sony headphone comes with inbuilt NFCThank you

928,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Overall nice product for the price. Not the best out there but for someone looking for a Bluetooth headset within budget, it's a really good deal. Battery lasts as well. But would personally recommend keeping another wired earphones for regular use or backup.
",4
929,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Over all good product. Battery backup is 7 to 8 hrs of usage. Fits well in ears. The only problem i face is that noise cancellation is very strong so if i m puttung on these bluetooth i m not able to listen to anyone.

930,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It's too long, the ear piece comes with no additional attachment it's having only one ear gripper where as many other brands give 2 to 3 attachment

",4
941,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It's not at all worth the money and the main reason is its wireless connectivity. Sounds keeps on distorting when you are in motion and your phone is in your pocket or at some distance and that's the main reason for using wireless headphones which this does not fulfils

946,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Don't buy this product it's. It stop working in 1 month and it look is very cheap when u put this bluetooth on ur neck. On more thing which I don't like it's sound quality.sound is loud but it's not working as Dolby and it's surrounding sound is very poor.
",2
947,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Do like the battery backup and the sound quality, for the price you pay you get a lot of earphone here. The design is quite good and you wouldn't notice it when wearing a t shirt. You do notice it while wearing a collared shirt but it's negligible at best.

948,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This is an amazing product. Delivered by Amazon within 12 hours with ""Morning delivery."" A small safety concern that whenever you are using the earphones, the surrounding sound is not audible at all, even if the volume is low. So use it carefully, stay safe and enjoy the product.

949,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Bought in October 2018, sending for replacement third time. These earphones have more time with boat for replacement than with me . Let's hope they don't replace it time with another faulty headset, Mike stops working,loses charge ,so basically it's a dud headset and a dud brand.

950,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"As mentioned every thing is as it is except noise cancellation. Outside noise irritates to the listener so much. Rest is very good.

1178,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Amazing product, good sound quality and it fits well. The headphone stoped working after 3 months but will have to say Boat has an amazing after sale service (replaced within 5mins and also offer puckup and drop service). I recommend this product.

1194,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It pains a lot after just 15 minutes. Not at all Recommended while riding vehicles.
",2
1195,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"This product surely does have good bass and it fits well. The main con would be that the wire extending from the neck band is unnecessarily long and the size cannot be reduced.

1201,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Best in the price range. A Good fit to ears. Amazing bass. Fantastic battery life, a moderate usage resulted to around 9 hours and continuous usage to 5.5 hours. Also, the voice over process for Bluetooth connectivity is surprising.

1202,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"Product quality is very poor. You don't know when it will die. Device will show Power level at >30% but suddenly it will drop to zero and die. Even though they gave 3 types of ear caps it won't fit. Overall it's not worth for money.

1203,1,boAt Rockerz 255,"It worked for six months and then I am facing power on failure. Now I have registered the complaint for the same. But their service is pathetic. Don't go for this product. If it will stopped working you won't get any service from boat support.
