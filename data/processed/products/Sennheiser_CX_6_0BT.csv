7177,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bought these headphones in September 2016. the photos i uploaded are from august 2018.i am writing this review after using these headphones for 2 years😅😅.I am a kind of rough user and still this lasted for more than 2 years.and today it broke becuase of my mistake...or else maybe it would have worked for atleast a year.Pros-Best headphone in a price rangeBest music outputBest voice qualityBest for receiving callsUsed them even in moderate rain(dont do it)Cons-Built quality is decent but it could be better as the wire started break after 1.5 years but still this baby worked as a charmSo you can buy it over mi headphones or boat as music isnt that sharp on them but built quality is good.Once again the the photos uploaded abover are after 2 years of rough usage...U should give it a try...

7178,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very good balance in bass and treble. Reflecting true music.Another Best thing  about this earphone has its.. noise cancellation and soft ear buds and extra L- shaped 3.5 mm jack.Wire quality is sturdy.Call quality is also crystal clear.

7180,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I usually don't write reviews, but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once, but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago, I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

7181,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have used wide ranges of earphones over years, some brands being Skullcandy (Smokin Buds 2), JBL (T 210), Sennheiser (HD 180, HD 210, CX 271, CX400 II Precision, CX 185 Street II, and now CX 275 S) Fiio (f1), Koss (Porta Pro) Audio Technica (ATHCOR150RD),First off there is a large difference between CX 185 Street II and CX 275 S don't even compare, CX 185 has too much of treble with very low bass, CX 275 S is very well balanced, CX 275 S reminds me of my CX 271 which I used for 7 years, its wire was of great quality and tangle free, I would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable,To anyone looking to buy earphones, go for Audio Technica>JBL if your budget is below 1k and Sennheiser CX 275 S if you just need the best audio output, and regarding other earphones I've used JBL has decent output, and regarding Fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap, it was an impulsive decision I made based just on the brand without any research, don't throw your money in garbage buying it, finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

7182,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Firstly I would like to appreciate Amazon.in for its amazingly fast delivery. The product reached in less than 24hrs and I opted for regular delivery.Now about the Product.I have used or still use products like Audio Technica ATH-M50X , Beats Studio, Powerbeats 2 , Jaybird X2 , Panasonic Extra Bass , Bose SoundTrue, Mi Piston3, etc .These Sennheiser earphones are firstly extremely comfortable and lightweight. They have a very loud sound output. The bass is 4/5, Treble is 4/5. The sound quality is rich and it doesn't feels like a sub 2k earphone. The earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.I purchased it for Rs 1600/- , it comes with a leather case and a L - Shaped converter which is very thoughtful .Overall i would highly recommend.

7183,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"After successful of senneheiser CX 180 Street II series I thought I have to purchase CX 275s with microphone. When I put on Dolby Atoms mode it is really work as a beast. Nice sound quality powerful bass. It's wirea are thin but looks sturdy and strong I think it would be long lasting headset. And also One & Only Senneheiser name is enough for music lovers. Many people have different kind of ear phone but when I say I have this beast Senneheiser CX 275s other guys said Dada tusi great ho. Really appreciate you Senneheiser!!!:) How could YOU make this type sound quality which have other have name & brand name also but no one can beat you... Thanks a lot for making this kind of ear phone. And also Many Many thanks for Amazon to giving me this type deal and headset. This is gift fromy lovely DAD. Thanks PAPA...for UR love.

7184,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Ordered 2. In that, one started to malfunction within few days. Right side is not audible.

7185,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I don't know why this earphone is getting a lot of hate from a lot of people. Quite frankly I've tried tons of earphones at this price point and personally the right amount of bass and excellent lows and mids would describe this earphone. If you want Xtreme bass then I would suggest you to go for Sony or JBL earphones. But this is a balanced earphone with the right amount of bass and good clarity.

7186,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"1st.. I will not say the buit quality is the best but it's good, you have to handle with care. Nd the good point is,there is a pouch with nice quality & looks.2.. Main thing I love the most in Sennheiser is its sound quality.  The sound is Crystal clear. You won't miss a single component of music. The bass vocal treble are balanced. Just catch it if you are a music lover.

7187,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Never Expected such poor quality product from Sennheiser.Normal Sound quality No Bass Effect Poor Battery life and no music forward backward option ,bike riders never ho go this product.Its not at all worth for 7.5k .Few guys rated this product 4.5 * .I guess those guys are new to earphone world 🤣🤣

7188,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. I will try to keep it short and to the point.Note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product, do scan the QR code given on the box.So here we go :👉Look And FeelPremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. The material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. The earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. The three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.👉ConnectivityThe CX6 from Sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. I have tested it with a distance  of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.👉Battery and ChargeThe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. But the best part is it supports Quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.👉Sound OutputThis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. I have used BT headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point, its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. The sound is crisp and clear. The treble is just awesome, you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. The bass should have been a little more because thats what I like but again thats depends on person to person. But I can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.For those giving negative reviews, its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.👉CALL QUALITYHave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days, I have tried to use it as rough as I could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. The sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when I was in the noisiest condition. Never faced any issue over call quality till date. But many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. Kudos✌️👉VERDICTSANHEISER has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. If you are a Sanheiser user, there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product, you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy Sanheiser for the first time, reading reviews wont help you, you need to make a BUY and experience it yourself. Since I have been using this product, I can assure you that using BT headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. I hope that this review has made you make an informed PURCHASE decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping !!

7189,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pros:Really good quality sound.Perfect balance of treble and bass.Value for money.Lightweight.Good for every genre of music.Cons:Really thin wire seems fragile I fear I might accidentally rip them with simple pull.Three button pad is big compared to the thin wire, it just looks ugly in my opinion.sometimes i hear distortion when i listen to hip hop.I mostly listen to all genres.These give better kicks when listened to rock.More dept when listened to edm.These are definitely better than the previous pair (RHA M390U) which I've owned. Enhances the sound quality. You need to have good quality mp3 files to get most out of this earphone. Gives me studio feel even when I'm in public. Earbuds are very comfortable in my ears. I could hear instruments which I've never heard before in  songs. Definitely best earphones I've owned. Feels like there's orgy in my ears when I listen to songs with these. It's like someone's pouring sweet syrup in my ears.

7190,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Disappointed with the build quality the wire broke when the earphones were connected to my phone and i accidentally dropped it besides the bass Was not worth

7191,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good sound quality, but Almost no sound is coming from right side earpiece after 7 months of use.

7192,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"People who are looking for bass, go find it elsewhere. This headphone is for people who love to listen to crisp and clear audio with just enough bass as is required. Sample the song life of ram from 96 and there was no second thoughts in buying this.

7193,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Let me get this straight, the sound from these is amazing. The highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. Recommended for bass heads. Fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.Now the shortcoming, these earphones are not durable. The wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. In the unit I received, sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. But as Sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty, they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. Right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.

7194,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have purchased this product on 2017 November with a  warranty for 2 years  product really worked too good during its life time, since 2 days sound is one ear-pad  and the other is not working fine , kindly do the needful.

7195,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I purchased this product during last week of October in special offer price. Totally convinced about the product and it’s an amazing and awesome product- Bluetooth enabled earphone connects 2 devices. Used by me for regular phone calls in office as well for listening music during travel time. It’s a device with perfect sound proof from external disturbance.

7196,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Guys I'm writing this review after using samsung gear iconx 2018, Skullcandy method wireless, did a try out Bose 10k RS inear wired headset from Bose showroom. Of all the headset this is the best headset. Guys...do go for it...u will not be disappointed. Worth every penny. BTW Samsung gear iconx is the worst of all.

7197,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat EQ, and this pair is no different. I really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. If you like bass, something from Sony would be better for you.
",4
7198,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Just for music listening this is Best earphone, But for attending phone call microphone is not good.During call you can clearly hear peer user voice but peer user don’t hear you clearly maximum time. Other end user hear echo of what you say, voice of people around is also captured by microphone even though they are 10-15 feets away

7199,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using cx180 since almost 4 years. Those earphones were of much better quality than the cx275s.The sound quality is OK, but the wires are too thin and feels very delicate. Apart from the quality, I had hard time authenticating the earphones from sennheiser, as the QR code on the box doesn't work anymore and the customer care services over the call & mail are Horrible. After wasting cumulatively 3 hours over the phone listening to YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US, PLEASE HOLD THE LINE  and WASTING 4 days, (including sat and sun)  I had given up all the hopes and decided to send the product back to Amazon. But still somehow I convinced myself to keep the earphones ( may be due to the Positive Amazon reviews and my experience with Cx180.I Just hope that I never get a chance to use their warranty services.

7200,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Starting with the package, the box the earphone comes in is very beautiful.Now coming to the earphone itself.Sound quality:Bass is good and of high quality, highs and lows good and overall listening quality is enjoyable.Mic:Crystal clear mic, Works well, very less noise while calling.Comfort:Very comfortable. The earhooks on the back of the ear doesn't seem to hurt in longer usages. The overall weight of the earphones is less and hence is very comfortable
",5
7201,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser CX275s is a superb in the ear headset. Sound quality is awesome with clear reach bass. Carry with a synthetic pouch & a 3.5mm connector. Packaging also great. Only cons was wire too thin. Before I used cx180. After 10months used cx180 one-sided earphone was showing defects. I login a complain. I would send that product to sennheiser headquarters. Then they should send a new product to me between 10days. I want say to sennheiser you are No1 brand in the world,  so concentrate on wire quality. Then no any other brand can reach you
",5
7202,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The build quality of the headphones are pretty nice. The wires look very thin and fragile though. Three types of earbuds were provided. The pouch given with the headphones are very useful for carrying the headphones around. Value for money.The jack could have been angled instead of being straight to avoid getting frayed. It hasn't frayed till now though. Very few headphones come with 2 years warranty in this range so that's a plus point.The listening experience is pretty decent. The bass is well balanced. Mic and mic button function very well. The mic works well when its held close to the mouth.
",5
7203,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is one of the best product at this price point. The sound quality is just amazing. Loved it. Treble is on point. Bass is powerful. Mids are balanced. Overall a joy to hear music in these earphones.Build quality is also very good. Using for around 6 months. No problem whatsoever.I would strongly recommend senheiser over other manufacturers.
",5
7204,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using these headphones for over a year now and there is zero complain on it. the bass of the sound is perfect even the 4D sounds are really cool you can hear them really well. The product comes with three ear buds in different sizes so you can select the one which fits your ear properly. the noise cancellation it is awesome once plugged into your ears it cancels out the sound from out completely and it detangles easily, have a long wire, the microphones are good to communicate hence one could not ask better from earphones.

7205,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"One side of earplugs isn't working properly getting proper sound from right the mic is not that great as expected..

7206,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I would have given 2 stars to the product has it not been for Sennheiser's after sales support.The product build quality is not great and it developed wrinkles at multiple place with normal usage. The wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places. Even the music was not extraordinary but it was definitely decent.However, the mic and earphones were good if you compare it to other brands, just that it did not meet the high expectations one normally associates with Sennheiser. One of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. But a big THANKS to the best after sales support of Sennheiser, the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!Kudos to Sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.I will buy Sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because I am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.Verdict - Buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of Sennheiser. Audiophiles can look for other options!

7207,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I recently bought a Sennheiser CX213 earphone for just Rs.699/- from flipkart ,over the years I have been buying headphones of different makes including Bose & to my pleasant surprise the no frills 213 exceeded all my expectations.The Sennheiser CX 275 S has a mic & comes with add-ons such as a nice leatherette pouch, two pairs of extra earbuds of diff sizes for better ear canal fit and a L cable adapter for Rs.1648 on Amazon but quality and performance wise CX213 is a much better product at less than half the price of  CX 275 S.So if you don't mind the absence of a mic and want to just listen to music or watch videos go for CX213 hands down. Quality of the wire in CX 213 is much better than that of the CX 275 S & longer too.
",3
7208,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Less bass with more clarity. Idle for long listeners and not recommended for bass lovers. You won't stress out even after listening for hours. Am using this from past 4 years and I don't see any wear n tare on it and also because I handled it carefully
",4
7209,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"A decent pair of earphones, and pretty damn solid for the untrained ear. It's fairly loud, and a little heavier on the bass side which at times makes the audio a little murky, but for the most part, above average at this price range. The most disappointing feature about these earphones is the quality of the materials used to make it. Nothing short of awful, it's very fragile and if not given extreme care will break. Heck even the cheap ₹300 MI earphones have better build quality than this. So, an absolute no go for rough users.I would recommend this to casual home listener's who can take care of their gear.

7210,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I don’t think there is any match for these Sennheiser earphones !!! Absolutely amazing !!!I had an earlier version of these from last 5 years and just because they worn out I had to keep them aside.. I’ve had iPhone’s earpads, audio technica, Sony, Phillips, mi n few others, nothing satisfies as these do. The moment you have them in your ears, it reduces 40% of external noise(remember these are wired earphones).The sound(music, voice, movie) it just heard in your head. Not the ears..,!!
",5
7211,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pros:1) probably the best nice cancellation earphones at this price.2) you'll feel each and every nood seperately.3) great for those who don't like bass hevey garbages.4) Carrying punch is of good quality.5) The music will not be distributed when your earphones cable collide with your clothes or hands ( hope you're getting what I'm trying to say)Cons:1) Low bass ( bid still that's more than enough for me)2) Earphones are not tangle free.3) Thin cable, so requires extra care(so it's not for kids and idiots)
",3
7212,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The battery life is a little low for my taste. Apart from that, CX 6.00BT are a solid pair of earphones with well built structure and housing for the drivers; they have a wide frequency spectrum with pretty flat sound signature with a little bit of coloring (boosted bass and treble frequencies). Sennheiser’s engineering is yet again proven to be the best. CX 6.00BT may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, but trust the Sennheiser’s reputation and you’ll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth Sennheiser’s products are. Sennheiser is a German company, and Germans are known for their engineering skills, even in audio.Note: for people looking for bass heavy earphones, CX 6.00BT should not be one of your choices.
",4
7213,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Used the earphones for over 7 hours today on a train journey, absolutely no fatigue or any kind of irritation on or in the ears, the large caps provide a snug fit and cancel out external noise to a great extent, the wires look deceptively thin, but can make out it is quality build, reason for 4* & not 5*is because the wires get tangled way too easily and frequently, which is very annoying, also not rating below 4*is purely coz of the worldwide warranty it's not going to WOW at this price range is my personal opinion, definitely more than a good product without doubt, especially comfort level (4.5)update : after 6 months of use, it's sturdy as hell! Definitely worth the money
",4
7214,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I think sennheiser has degraded the built quality of these pair of earphones I'm saying this on behalf of my personal experience because I have been using this earphones from 2015(from croma at rs 1600) and again I bought it in dec 2018 but from Amazon at rs1585 (price in croma rs 1699 on dec.25.2018). I found the sound quality is still ok but they have degraded the built quality .
",3
7215,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nothing special if only you want to use mic then go for it good if you really want to it used for for listening music then don't go for these earphones that is distort while using with equaliser or at high volume better go for XB55 or XB75 Sony earphones which i purchased one month after this one. I think I have used XB350 earphones of Sony earlier for 2 years that is why I was not satisfied but the thing is that the build quality of these Sennheiser earphones is not good and also have distortion. Go for Sony XB55 if you really want great sound blindly.Pic attached, one side sienhieser and one side Sony xb75ap.

7216,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The product Sennheiser CX 275 S In -Ear Universal Mobile Headphone With Mic (Black), it claims universal but it dose not support all MOBILE PHONE!! This vital information Amazon or seller has not mentioned anywhere and Pure case of misleading the customer.The Phone which it supports is mentioned in the inside of the packet which is visible only once you open the complete pack.The built quality is very Cheap.As it didn't work with my phone cant comment on voice quality.Total disappointment/worst product/ False claim

7217,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pros:1. Nice Sound quality (4/5)2. Earphone fits easily (3.5/5)3. Call quality while receiving call is good (4/5)Cons:1. Build quality is not that great because of thin wire. Either it will get cut off or tangled easily, you have to be bit careful(2.5/5) for build qualityOverall  Value for money. You will get best earphone in mid range earphone.
",4
7218,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"One of the most regrettable purchases. Sound quality is absolutely horrible. Tested on various sources like 4 different phones, DAP, Headphone amps. Pathetic. Item is only replaceable and not refundable. My friends Mi Piston earphones are way better than this. Very thin and flimsy build to add to the agony.
",1
7219,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Though on the expensive side of the earphone market,the cx-275s from Sennheiser is one of the most loved and trusted headphones in the segment.Plenty of reasons for this support namely the Amazing Sound Quality from the Earphones,the Good looks of the headphone and German Built.However,the wire is rubberised and may seem fragile to many while the 3.5mm jack connector shouldn't be handled roughly as chances are that the wire may get loose and you may get distorted sound.Overall,a good product with some great audio quality to make you enjoy your moments even more.
",4
7220,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser CX225S has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. I love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. I use the small ones. They're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.The mic is pretty much what made me buy this. Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse. Mutes my voice completely on the other side. Consider this if you use a Nokia phone.
",4
7221,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Thump is here....what can I say just buy it and feel the thump sennheiser is like Bose substitute...u won't feel to keep it back just always like to put on and have fun....writting it after 2 years of use and not a single defect wires look sleek but are damn high durable as it used to get entabgled to my bikes handle and boss it still rules over every other earphone in this price range like a thallaiva....GERMAN ENGEERING AT ITS BEST IS WHAT SENNHEISSEER RESEMBLES.
",5
7222,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"So I have been using the current pair of CX 275s for more than 6 months now. I use them regularly on my daily commute (of an hour) to work on my bike as well as in the office for Skype calls (which usually means nearly 4-4.5 hours out of the 9 hours at work)The Sound quality is good. However, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. The 2 year warranty that is provided, makes these the most bang for buck earphones. If ever, you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period, replacement is quite hassle free. (Applies to the CX180 as well which I owned earlier as well)To sum it all up, if you are looking for a good pair of multi-purpose earphones for regular use you cannot go wrong with these.
",4
7223,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"CONS:I was a bit skeptical of buying the Sennheiser CX 275 due to the reactions on it's durability. I was correct on that part, the wires are too thin making the device vulnerable to wear and tear (and we are considering to buy a wire protector).PROS:Apart from that we have been blown away with the comfort while listening to media, it does not stress out your ears. Noise cancellation features are true to what they have claimed and the music streaming is the best( true to their reputation)All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase just that need to be a but careful with the product ( cannot be handled as how we really do with our usual earphones)
",4
7224,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"IMPORTANT: This earphone is a quality product. Anywhere below ₹1400 it is a great buy. The value does drop below ₹1400 on sale and special occasions.DESCRIPTION:Included with the earphone is a beautiful leather pouch and differently sized earbuds.The bass is good and the audio clear.You may think it is fragile but it will surprise you.The wire is mostly tangle free.Noise cancellation is good too.
",5
7225,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is for clarity of sound. Keeping Price in mind - it could be one of the best options. Excellent for calls. Good for Music. It is quite balanced. This is not for Bass lovers at all - about right on all bands. Loudness is perfect. You will probably not need to play it full volume ever.Cable is not sturdy or strong - be careful not for rough use.Apart from that it comes with required stuff - like variable size tips - choose carefully to get Noise Cancellation.Very Light and comfortable - you will not feel it.It has everything that is a sign of great design - L - Shape Connector, Leather Bag.Given the on-the-go use case that this product is primarily for - a Good Sturdy cable is the only thing that I marked it 4 start for - otherwise - it is highly recommended.
",4
7226,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Definitely this is not for the base lovers. Very low base sometimes not that too. Not loud. I have to increase the audio level to 70% and higher to hear it well. Even a low range earphone can perform well compared to this. Please don't buy it. I even doubt on its originality. I used cx275 previously which was too good and this one is terrible.
",1
7227,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"After using for a month, the  battery stands for 5 hr . Even if the battery is 30 to 40 % it keeps yelling , battery is low charging is required which is little bit annoying.Sound quality is good and even when traveling in trains it did not get much distracted / disconnected .Good piece for this pricing.But as the brand,  it little bit discourages regarding the sound quality while playing songs mainly the bass.

7228,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Don't think these are suitable to working out but are pretty good for general lifestyle usage. The wire is long but is meant to only stretch upto an extent, do NOT test its durability. Sound and mic quality is pretty good, I've been using it for 2 years almost and quality is still brilliant.The silicon ending of the earphone might break but it's not noticeable, the important problem is that the earbuds fall off when you use it a lot as it becomes looser, you get a replacement back (although different sizes only) so that's good.I'd say if you're looking for cheap, good earphones with a mic, this is the one.

7229,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Worst.  For 1700 this is a crap. Can think to buy for Rs. 699. Poor bass genuinely there is no bass.  And there is no option for return . Replacement of the same product nonly available. Disappointed totally.

7230,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Have been using this earphone for the past 10 days. For me, this ticks all the boxes, perfect sound quality, light weight, good fit and in ear comfort. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily use earphone.Only drawback is that no pouch came along this. Last year I had purchases the previous version of the sennheiser earphone and it came with a good pouch, but this one even though double the cost, did not have a carry pouch.. otherwise the product is great.

7231,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is the second time I've bought this brand and model. The first was 1.5 years ago and it lasted me a whole 1.5 years before dying on me.This model from Appario Retail has barely lasted me 2 months before sound is fading off and on in my right earbud. Wondering if it's an original/refurbished model. Plan to check with the Sennheiser store.

7232,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If it falls in your budget, get it. That's all there is to it.I was restricting my budget to 900 because I have never felt the need for an expensive earphone despite my dialy use,so I kept pushing my purchase of the 275 for 3 years. Finally I decided to get it and it's great. I loved the cx 180 and this is even better. Very crisp,clear and decent noise masking. It's light,it's comfortable. It's got a mic that makes superb calls. I don't think you can beat this ,despite the premium over the JBL c100SI

7234,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. These aren't for bass listeners. These are only for high fidelity sound listeners. I am using Sennheiser since 5 years firstly CX 180, then CX 3.00, and now CX 2.00G. These have a perfect flat sound response. Has High Treble, Balanced Bass.The only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity, sweat, and water. I had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in Mumbai. The one side that encountered sweat, or humidity and sounded a little low. But got replaced in the Service Center. Just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. Their service centers are only big cities in India, and getting them replaced is a tedious task. Sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. I had used CX 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way I had put them in Washing Machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). So for the sound, these are perfect, but only if you prevent it from water.

7235,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so I went for this one.And...now I feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. Balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. Base is on the heavier side. Overall audio quality is just amazing.I purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which I didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. Go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.

7236,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Well first things first .Awesome product jst buy it ..But here are some pros and cons .Pros:-1. good clear crips sounds.2. Bass is adequate enough but i think it is lacking bass .( but enjoyable )3. design is good .4. noise cancellation is good.5. 2 warranty is great .Cons:-1. The wire is so thin I'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.Bass is not enough i think (considering the price).Overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .

7237,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The earphones are stylish and fit perfectly well in you r ears as you place them in.You don't need to press it in unlike other earphones, reducing the damage, typical in-ear earphones cause your ears.Coming to the sound quality, the high and mid frequencies can be heard very clearly. Wouldn't say 5 on 5 though. Listening to the low frequencies or the bass in other words was quite disappointing for the price you pay. Bass quality - 2 on 5.Overall you could but them for ₹1000 bucks may be. It's not worth ₹2000.It's disheartening even writing this as I'm a big fan of Sennheiser.I've used the CX180, CX275s and both were worth the buy. Amazing products by Sennheiser. But the CX 2.00 is not just not worth it but you could buy the other two that I mentioned above as they're cheaper and better I believe.

7238,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I like the clarity of these headphones. Noise cancellation works best if there is a good seal between your ear cavity and the head phones. However, this tends to prevent air circulation within the ear for me. I found this air tight feeling to be uncomfortable. Hence, I usually wear these headphones with some clearance so that air can flow freely into the ear cavity. However, this results in reduced noise cancellation properties. Overall, these are a good bunch of headphones!

7239,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is my second Sennheiser ear phone where the volume has gone down significantly within 4 months of buying the product. I have tried to contact the service center multiple times but no one picks up the phone. Will not recommend this product to anyone.

The best part is few days back it was having some issue so i went to sennheiser Service center and they replaced it immediately. I am very happy for their service. I do recommend to all if anybody love music they can go ahead with product, may be you'll say the price of this product  is a bit higher than other brands but i would say quality and service of this brand is best. A big thanks to Sennheiser.

7243,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First of all,  I love the design of the earbuds, very unique. I was using Sennheiser CX180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. Jst that they didnt have a mic so I got these. They are very comfortable and sound quality is great, balanced. Only the cable is too thin, looks fragile it was like that on CX180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.I ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes, but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. :)

7244,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound is absolutely superb for this price. No complaints. ALSO a superb faux leather pouch free with it!Cons:The plug is a straight one, instead of a 90° bent one. So it'll definitely be kinked there and prone to break.The wires are very thin and round. Feels very flimsy. I don't know how long it'll last. I'd recommend some wire protectors.The in ear plugs are just okay. Not too happy about the shape and size of it.

7245,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I'm writing this review after about 6 months of use.Material quality:The build quality of this product isn't on par with with some other products at this price range as the wires are thin and unbraided which often causes them to get entangled pretty easily.Durability:After 6 months there is normal wear and tear which also depends upon individual use but they are working just fine.Sound quality:The most important one for most of us,so the sound quality is what made me fall in love with these earphones.They're just perfect for my taste as the bass isn't that intense and the mids and lows are just on spot.To sum up:It's a pretty decent pair of earphones for their price with great sound and average build quality.I say go for it.Ps: if you are confused between jbl's earphones and this one,just go for these as they sound much better

7246,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"My Mother is pleased with these earphones. The Sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.Personally I found the audio to be okay-ish. The loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive, overwhelming other sounds. It is not bad but it is lacking the signature Sennheiser balance and quality.This may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. Audio over USB is low energy, and these loud earphones should even it out. My Mother is using this with a Le 2.

7247,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These are incredible Headphones. I had bought a one three years back. There is hardly any damage to the headphones. I use them for taking calls, listening to music, working out, etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.The buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.The music quality is excellent.The bass is punchy and not super thumping. The mids and highs are balanced. I used songs like Jumbalika, Thriller, etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.Recently I had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1More Dual Driver and Boat Nirvana Tres Headphones in most features.I'm quite satisfied with this buy.
",5
7248,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Its best headphone with clear sound and amazing bass, although the effect of base is best while listening it in less noise. As it doesn’t have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. That is, it’s great for general commute. Its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.Although it’s not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with Samsung or some selected device. And it is also mention on its cover.Comparing it with Sony MDR series (extra bass series) Schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality, although it depends on your taste but it like Sony MDR series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. Schneider (This model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound, other than sound it’s also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.The only thing it lag is the build quality, in almost same price tag Sony MDR series are IP68 and build to last till you are bored with it. While this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with Schneider is lesser service centre in India.So, if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try Schneider’s higher sports model or try Sony, Skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it’s the best in this price range.

7250,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good BT earphones, but JBL and Sony have dissapointed at the lower end. Most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. So I'll keep this about sound quality only, as the range and battery life is as good as the others. Many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of Bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the Sennheiser 275, which is a huge compliment for a BT Earphone in this class. Since the bass is not overpowering, the mids and highs are crisp and clear  , resulting in true sound. Yes, the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on Sony XB55AP, but it is just good enough for Knopfler or Gilmour's guitar to sound true. While I love the Bose Truly Wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!), I found this close to Bose Soundsport BT performance at half the cost.Bottomline: If you're a Sennheiser loyalist, you won't be dissapointed at this price point. They are light, don't feel much, fit right and have awesome build quality.  These are the best BT earphones I've heard under 10k.

7251,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive, I felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package, I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was, indeed. My primary concern allayed, I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic, I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music, from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price, these earphones are a steal. I'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.

7252,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"prior to this earphones i have used JBLT150A, Sony MDR-EX150AP, Sennheiser CX 180  all of them were good products which lasted 2 years  except JBLT150 which i had to replace after 6 months. i tested Sennheiser CX 275 when my friend bought it and i knew which earphone would be my next daily driver. Its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low, high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar,flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it  worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

7253,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Believe me guys, these are way better than Skullcandy method earbuds. I bought these because my methods worn off. I was a little skeptical about these, but after listening to just one song, I could tell the difference between my Skullcandy methods and these. The bass is good, treble is good, it just ticks all the boxes for me.Just that I could be a little cheaper. 2345/- is a bit too much for this model (because it is not the latest one). Overall, if you can buy these, surely go them.

7254,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"A review by a sound enthusiast.Awesome Sound quality of mids and treble, clear and pleasent treble , smooth and soft mids but one needs to equalize the freqencies a bit for that perfect balance of mids and trebl.andNeodynamium magnet - So Active BASS outputBass is preset low by default on this but..This earphone has capability to produce Bass more then your ears can handle  but to produce that much of bass a custom audio driver is required.to play low and ""feel the pressure"" of this frequency one needs an audio driver which amplifies this frequency range.Mobile phones doesn't have this amplification....and cannot be done much with an equalizer from playstore.So dont judge this on its default low bass setting.One con is wire is too thin.. and can easily break. Other then that an awesome earphone in every aspect except thin wire.

7256,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First things first, this is not a noise cancellation earphone. It's runner plugs keep outside sound from reaching the ear drums.

Highs, mids and lows are very well balanced, you can hear every note and instrument in the background. Can be a suitable alternative to Bose in ear wired headphones. The only place where Bose notches up is in the reproduction of overall sound, which gives a surround sound like feel.. and no doubt more clearer sounds.

Thump : more than enough thump for the beats which also produces a more than decent amount of bassA kick-ass hearing experience. For that if you could adjust little bit of your equalizer well from internal setting then it will be with you for sure2. Clearly awesome in highs n lows n mids as well .. again make proper equalizer even if you don't do it its there ..sound quality is just there3. Vocals - if there are more than a person singing a song at a time . Trust me you can hear both the voices clearly along considering above 2 points (bass, highs, lows and mids)4. Best fit in the ear - small and light weight so you don't have to adjust now n thenSome improvement areas -Need to give promising build qualityWires are very thin but decent to useEarbuds given are not that comfortable so I replaced them with my old ones

7264,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using Sennheiser CX 275 for last 1 year and i am very happy with its overall performance. The build quality is excellent, sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation is good.One important note : - i had issue with one of the earpiece ( noise was not coming) within 3 months of purchase. But Sennheiser has superb after sale service. They replaced and gave me a new pack of Sennheiser CX 275.

7265,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. The moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in, there wasn’t any resistance in inserting them. The angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren’t irritated anymore and I have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. This for one has two variants and I wasn’t aware that one supports the android and the other iOS.The reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence I chose the wrong OS headset since I use Apple. That may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and I seriously fear that because of this I might not utilise the product’s life.Altogether put it’s a great product and if you’re looking for Android CX2.00G is your model and CX2.00i is your iOS variant. Be cautious and order accordingly, unlike me.

7266,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Ordered product on early september 2018, delivery was timely as usual. After approximately 6 months of use, here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. Means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and I have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser, this simply is negligence. Now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.But then, you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway, a 4 star from my side. Fix the left right issue, and its a 5 star product.

7267,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Writing this review after I used it for more than 3 years. So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. Though I don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products, I had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. Believe me I'll again go for this if I had to buy a new one. The best in this price segment.

Therefore, I purchased this product thrice, twice from online and once from croma store.The only thing of disappointment is it's durability. Its doesn't last for a year. All became unserviceable.

So to listen to music and watch movies without fatigue and noise of the train is very much important for me. To put in short, this ear phone is neutral. Sound quality of this ear phone is  very good. Those who love neutral sound (which is the best option to listen to all types of music), can very well opt for this. Sound equilibrium from high freequency to low without distortions is well maintained. (I can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. Play ""Bohemian Rhapsody by queen. The song covers all most all freequency levels, with different vocals and instruments.)  No sickening high bass. Those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.But....... This product is not worth what it costs. The same quality of Sound can be obtained from a JBL  C100SI earphone as well (Durabilty of the mentioned JBL product is below average. I couldnt even use it for one year)  but it costs only half the price of this  product.

7272,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It has been more than 3 years since I bought this headphone. Iam completely satisfied with it. But one side of the headphone has stopped working now and Iam thinking of buying a new one. I have been contemplating for a while but could not think of any other product than this one. If Iam going to buy a new one, it will be the same model. For any headphone, 3 years is a good span and Iam sure that if we protect the portion near the plug from being worn out, it will definitely last much longer. Usually in any headphone , one side of it stops working because the wire near the plug portions gets worn out with time.

7274,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is a defective piece. Instead of noice cancellation, it is amplifying the surrounding noice.As a result surrounding noice is more clearly audible than my sound to the other person.I just want to return this product.

7275,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"After using 1 month the jack pin wire start giving trouble hence, I would suggest Dont buy. They had mentioned warranty and all but in actual there is no warranty and amazon will not be able to replace it once it is damaged.

7276,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is very good. Perfect amount of voice, music and bass. Soothing to listen to music.Perfectly fits in the ear, though it pains little if used for long time more than an hour.Material quality is good but need to be careful with handling as the wires are thin.Faced little issue with mic as the other person heard a bit less sound while talking, need to hold little close to mouth. Not big issue can be managed.Product comes with two years warranty under 2k which says a lot about product quality and duration to use without any hassle. Have used previously neck earphone of same brand. Worked perfectly for more than 2 years. So i have no doubt in their quality.Overall the product is amazing. Would recommend for buying.

7277,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Senheiser is best known for best quality earphones.Previosly I used Sennheiser CX 275 S earphones which was One of the Best in its range.Later I think of buying another one from Senheiser, So Ordered Sennheiser CX 2.00G (Which is costly than Senheiser CX 275 S) But Got Totally disappointment. Sennheiser CX 2.00G do not worth a 500 rs cost.I am writing names of earphones again N again because I found that Review Content for both the earphones 1-  Sennheiser CX 275 S, 2-  Sennheiser CX 2.00G is same. Amazon is showing same reviews for both the earphones. But both are totally different in Quality.Check the reviews here,- https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00NQ17ZUS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1- https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B008V6T1IW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

7278,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Purchased this earphone to attend voice calls and telephone meetings and liked the voice clarity a lot. Voice is very clear and crisp. It is also delivers good performance while playing music, bass is soothing and not very high. To compare, I also have Sony WI-C400 in-ear headphones but it gives poor audio, inspite of comfort of neckband i have to forgo it for sake of voice clarity on wired Sennheiser CX 275. I am rating it low in terms of material quality and durability as it's wire appears delicate.
",5
7279,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These are pathetic earphones for such a high price. I bought them after seeing good reviews but ended up feeling bad for taking a bad decision of buying them. They advertised as noise cancelling which is not. There is not any quantable noise cancelling or noise reduction. They feel loose in the ear and won't be comfortably inside the ear. After not more than a month of use, microphone is not working. Dealing with Senheiser Customer care now. Don't go for these ear phones. There is a reason why they are selling for 2.5k while the MRP of product is 4.5K. Because they are bad performing. Don't buy them.

7281,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I bought this primarily for audio calls. The mic and the voice clarity is excellent.In addition to this the music clarity is great.The only thing I felt to be improved is the thickness of the cable. The cable is thin when compared to other similar products.But the advantage is that this comes with 2 year warranty.Recommended to anyone who is looking for a good earphone with great sound and mic clarity.

7282,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have no issues with Amazon delivery, it's seamless as expected.Product is great too but it's too delicate.The pluggable Pin is damaged in 6 months. When I connect it to a device and play music, it plays in only one of ears, and, when I try adjusting the pin while connected the device, it flickers and starts playing in both ears and any movement of either ear phone pin or the device, it again stops playing in one of the ears.I have not yet taken to Sennheiser service centre as their working hours are only on week days so it makes very difficult to  get it done.Over all, these ear phones give best sound but too delicate to use outdoor on daily basis.

7284,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I purchased both Cx 180 and Cx 275s. After few months of use earbuds quality of Cx 180 is still same while Cx 275s hardly fits in my ear now. Cx 180 has more bass and good audio output whereas Cx 275s sounds more of treble and overall experience music quality is degraded .

7285,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good product, Sound clarity is good and noice cancellation is well. beforeto buy this  i was using CX180 and i lost while travelling . i specifically buy this  because of in build micro phone. The only head set with mic in this budget is this head set only. so  those who wants headset  with mic option can buy this , if the mic is not necessary then go with CX180. But in CX 180 have low quality of wire. you have use up to 2 years , if your are a hard user.

7287,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good earphones but they don't have volume control. I had assumed (stupid me) that at this price point, they would just be created with them, like magic! But no. I usually get soundmagic e10c instead. They've less bass but better build quality and volume control.
",4
7288,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First of all its an amazing product with good build and sound quality. But I was disappointed when I played EDM's , R&B etc. Because even though the quality is amazing this product lacks bass, which is kindo disappointing for someone like me who listen to every type of music. So keep in mind don't purchase it if u are someone who only listen to music which is bass oriented.
",3
7289,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Wanted to buy this headphones for very long and finally got good deal on Amazon.Built quality could have been better. Wire is thin and feels very delicate. Also wire tangles easily. Although Sennheiser trust is there and I'm hoping headphones will last for long. As of now it's hard to tell if this headphones can handle the rough treatment.Sound is just great. Not a audiophile and don't know about the notes and all but when you plug in these headphones and start the music you can easily notice the clarity in music. I previously used Sennheiser CX213 but I find these headphones to be better. In line mic is good and works well during call.Overall these are great headphones in given price range. Definitely worth the money.
",5
7290,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I really don't like these. Fit is bad, sound is just fine, almost no bass, call quality is worst and you feel like two big jhumkaas hanging from your ears. It's the worst choice I ever made in gadgets I guess.
",2
7291,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Material quality could have been improved. Wires are way too delicate and could break anytime in case of even partial rough use.Sound quality is good in terms of price. I would not say its excellent because for excellent quality You would have to pay an excellent amount of money too.I have been using it for 2 months now. Material used for wires is the only concern which will directly going to impact the durability of the product.
",4
7292,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality awesome. Fixes in ear easily. The only suggestion is if you can start making the jack for the iPhone users too. Right now I have to connect the connector separately to use the earphones which looks odd. And iPhone connectors or earphones are very delicate, and destroy pretty fast.

7293,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I purchased this last week. Good delivery by Amazon, got it on second day.I've been trying different earphones of philips, sony, skullcandy and even steel series siberia v1(though it's built for gaming not for music) for long time to get the best earphone in my budget and now I tried this. I haven't experienced anything like this before. Excellent bass with crystal clear sound even at 10% volume and complete isolation from noise. If your phone doesn't support some of these earphones, no worries. A connector comes with the earphone for your phone.If you wanna have a new experience, try this...
",5
7294,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If I would have written a review in the initial days of usage of these earphones, it would have been an amazing review of the product. But after 6 months of usage, I observed a volume difference between the two ear buds. This is something that is damaging for the ear. No one would recommend using such a product. Sennheiser should really look into the product's performance in longer term(more than 6 months). If the product is not able to deliver as promised after 6 months, then it should be mentioned in the product's description.
",1
7295,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First off, great service by Amazon, received the earphones in less than 24 hours. Next, the sound quality of the earphones is phenomenal. Sennheiser, as usual, have one of the best sounds money can buy, and these are no different. Only downside is, the wire is so thin and fragile, I'm 99% sure it's not going to last the 2 years of warranty the earphones come with. Maybe a little stronger cord would do wonders. 4.8/5 stars.
",4
7296,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I normally don't write any reviews, but this masterpiece moved me to share my experience with this beast. First of all, the product is really premium in terms of sound quality, call clarity, material used, provided accessories. You can't find such a bass effect on a headphone as it looks simple but blows out the music experience. Only con is the product wears off in two years and this is my third purchase and I buy this only for the experience which no headphones had left me with. I would definitely recommend it for any music lovers and gamers.
",5
7297,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"after a month I am writing this review. the product looks like chines. no strength looks like something went wrong inside the headphone not working. whatever I totally not recommend to buy this product.  same or less price you would get other company blutooth headsets.advise for a company : please improve the quality. don't cheat the people.

7298,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bought it on May this year, now it's completely damaged from the inside even though it looks good from the outside. When the earphone is connected, it turns the volume up and down on it's own, plays or pauses the songs automatically and opens apps (especially Google assistant) on it's own. I thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs, I realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. Also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe I received a defective piece). It had more trebel and hardly any  bass. Even when I set my equaliser to bass boost, the bass quality was not that great. Infact the cx180 I had before sounded better than this.
",2
7299,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Volume seems to be very poor and sound can be heard only after raising the volume at least 50%. I got it replaced with another piece but still having the same issue. Also, this headphone doesn't have that punchy bass but clarity is very good and sound is crystal clear. So if you are a bass lover then may be its not a perfect choice for you.Also, the mic is not that good and i have to keep it very near to my mouth then only the other person can hear me properly. I wanted a replacement with another brand but seems seller doesn't have that in policy.

7300,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been a audiophile from over a decade and purchased this as a replacement to a Sennheiser earbud pair that i had purchased in Amsterdam a couple of years ago. I became a fan of what i had earlier and thought Sennheiser would have improved the model as this one was priced higher, but to my great disappointment... the grip is bad, cable is really cheap quality, noise isolation - almost nil and finally audio quality, less than average... i have bought a JBL for my daughter at half this price... would not recommend.

7302,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This here is the best of Sennheiser products. It's comfortable. it's got a microphone jack with call answer/pause/play button. It's sleek and easy to carry around. If you use it for at least 2-3 hours per day, every day, these will last 1-2 years depending of the nature of your use. Sometimes, rough handling can cause issues. I had my first pair for 2 years and now, I'm using my second pair..

7303,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Regularly normal pop music plays good. Without any enhancements.But, while playing done instrumental, and old Rock, some guitar solos only sound from left side, and other vocals from right, takes a little bit of time till it gets equalised. & whatever I do it won't get fixed.Wire quality is very flimsy, might break any moment.Worthless for ₹1400Not at all recommended.

7305,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am looking for a replacement of the product, within six /6 months, a piece broke of the mouth where you attach it to the phone & stayed stuck inside it so that I couldn't put or use any other earpiece even in place of your Seinheiser one for long time till I could take it to a repair hub where they removed it, but as it is broken, can't use it anymore, how is this possible that a high-end claimed to be high quality earpiece costing about 1500 bucks breaks within few months? Please arrange for a replacement ASAP immediately without fail from the company's side.

7306,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The product quality is not that good. Wire seams to be very cheap. Even after the discount not worth the price.. Very low bass.. even low cost earphones have rich bass..  We can increase the bass by using equilizer but even though with equilizer the experience improved very slightly and also after using Equalizer the voice losses it's originality. Will not recommend it if one is hoping for rich bass with quality earphone. Used JBL C100si (wired) and boat - Rs. 1500 (Bluetooth) both were way better then this. AVOID BUYING unless one is die hard Sennheiser Fan..

7308,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best pair of earphones used till date.Sound quality is excellent. Vocals clear.A beginner's option for people who prefer vocals over bass.Noise cancellation isn't the best but it does its job.You would definitely be disappointed if you go for these expecting bass. Its only flaw.Mine lasted for 2 good years on everyday use and then one of side just died so that's what you need to expect.

7309,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"the ear buds fit well, complete noise cancelation, perfect high, lows and mids. (buzz with ac/dc, led zeppelin, edm, trance, and oh dubstep, rock, metal, bass etc.. it delivers the punch everytime)  no burn in time required  (tweak your equalizer for custom sound of how you like it)  bass point on. mic picks up sound so well and the clarity of the sound other person hears is beyond any inbox mic headphones I've used.  cord is a bit thin kinda like audio technica thin, but it'll last long it seems.  the pouch /carry bag is superb. verify authenticity online and get the best part of 2yrs warranty.highly recommended for people with headphones dying every six months or so.  a good investment (2k is worth it. as 2yrs warranty)

7310,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First I would like to say that, there is sound quality& bass v/s any headphones with loud sound. I had used sennheiser few years back, after that I started experimenting with  other brands also like, Sony, JBL, Boat, Philips and even some local brand also but I never quite got that satisfaction which I used to get from Sennheiser.Great sound clarityNice bass,PERFECT FIT, And I mean it. Sennheiser fits just perfectly in my ears and doesn't fall out, neither does my ears pain if I use it for long time.Product quality is decent.Microphone is pretty normal just like any other headphones.

7311,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good clarity, however low on bass, sometimes a little metallic, quite hardy I must say cause I dropped it twice and there was absolutely no damage to the earphones. A little over-priced consider the Sony ones come within 1K. Overall a good deal.

7312,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I purchased this earphone a few days back and firstly the product that was delivered to me was defective.I replaced the same and it was delivered to me the next day itself.However the replacement is now not working properly and mic is also not responding.I feel cheated twice after such an experience.Will have to consider whether to shop again from Amazon.

7313,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pros: (Everything under this price range).1. Sound quality.2. Best bass.3. Call answering button along with mike. Which also got options to play/pause, Next song in your MP3 player.Cons.1. Wire quality: very thin2. No volume up/down button, they given in higher end. Just for this paying extra bugs is not worth.

7314,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser CX 275 S Headphone, is a simpler affair with just the ability to play music and handle calls when connected with your phone. – but with its clever design, intuitive controls and commendable performance, it’s no less desirable.

7315,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Got to say, not impressed.Sound profile is wide ,and the bass is spot on. Does not overpower vocals . But yet there is something missing idk what. The stereo effect is less.I compared it with my OneMore piston fit and Boat basshead 220 . It is better than both. But I've heard a lot of sony xb55 and one of the youtuber suggested it over the 275 .Be aware cause there is no refund after you buy it . There is only replacement . So make a wise decision and buy Sony XB55 AP instead.

7316,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I like to think of myself as an audiophile, and trust me I have tried numerous earphones, but by far these are my worst pick.The audio quality is Terrible, it's super flat. As much as you are tempted to buy them, DON'T!Even audio technical clr100 & JBL c150 si sounds mcuh better than these.I  extremely Regret buying these
",1
7317,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The major issue with this IEM is the build quality. The wire is so thin, it's almost on the verge of being invisible. The plastic used for mid and earset doesn't give any assurance either. The sound compared to other recent earphones in the same price segment is at best passable. The bass isn't rich, the music doesn't feel lively, although vocals seems fine.The right-side earphone stopped working after a year and a half, no  doubt due the higher probability of wear and tear with this set.Skip this, and go for Byron's or SOUND magic E 11 C
",3
7318,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is perfect in both low and high volumes also well equipped with bass. but paying such a price i also demand better built quality. it seems very fragile and even the cord is not tangle free on which i compromised. it is not a complete package i would say so if you are going to get this one you have to compromise on some of the aspects.
",5
7319,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First of all, I love Sennheiser. There's no one better in the game when it comes to audio equipments. Earphones are very durable. These have been in washing machine like 5-6 times now (mistakenly). But I just take them out and leave them for drying for 1-2 days and they are back to normal. Cord has been pulled numerous time. Twice, I thought no way these could survive through this much pulling force. But, I underestimated it. I got these as an upgrade from CX 180 after using them for 3 years. I recommend these.

7320,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"keep in mind to turn the volume dial down....these thing is scary loudand more scary when you add a portable amplifier with it............and for the ones who need a flat tone... don't mind taking it.....just tweak the equaliser to vocal or more mids and high to nullify the bassy side of it. loved the scary volume
",5
7321,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"1. Build quality is not the finest. You cannot expect such a low build quality from a Rs1400 earphones(price at the time when I bought it) from a brand like sennheiser. Specially the wire is  too thin.2. Sound quality is great , just what you expect from sennheiser. Bass is punchier. You can get a little bit of cracking in sound above 85%3. Definitely not a value for money product if you are seeking for good durable earphones

7323,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's light weight, and sound quality is descent. Only thing what I don't like is it's not durable. The wire with connector jack is fragile.

7324,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I could not find any headphones at this price range or below which provides awesome sound quality. But the wires are so delicate and if not handled carefully, there are greater chances of the wire being damaged. Been using it the past 1 year and after 8 months, the left earpiece stopped working. But was able to claim warranty without any hassle. Just make sure to buy it from reputated sellers to avoid getting non authentic one's.

7326,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser CX 275 are the best wired headphones available. The concentration is more on the quality of midrange output rather than ear deafening bass. One can put on these and listen for hours without any fatigue. Bass heavy headphones cause ear fatigue. The quality of sound gives you the opportunity to listen to those notes in your fav songs which you may have never been able to listen on a regular cheap bass heavy headphones.

7327,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It has great sound quality. No doubt in that. But the hardware part especially cables are so thin that a normal usage would tear them at the joints.I used it while running and in gym. the cable are almost torn.It is a great headphone to be used at one place such as office desk.Overall, go for it, if you want to have a static use of it.##Update: It has been a year now.

Try to mess with it will get damaged.2) Extremely thin wires makes it tangle easily.3) cannot distinguish left and right (maybe anyone can be used I presume)4) Cannot be used in extremes (running, gym-ing etc) - I fear of damaging it as it's so delicate.Amazon Service: One word for it - Amazing!!!

7333,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Awesome earphones I have ever used. I am big fan of music and high quality sound fascinates me. For me, compromising sound quality is a big deal. But, this product lives upto my expectations and beyond that! After using this earphone, I don't feel like using any other products. It's my 4th year with this earphone (of course I lost my previous one and had to order the same product!) and it does not disappoint me any day. Highly recommended for music lovers at this price which I think is quite affordable.

7334,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is excellent for this price range.i have compared it with other similar range head phones. I can't say that built quality is that good.everything is from plastic,but it won't hinder the sound quality.the wire could have been of a bit more thick and tangle free material.overall the product met my expectations.

7335,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"When I first tried these ear buds, I did not have them far enough inside the ear and the sound was very tinty.This morning, I seemed to have placed the buds further into my ears and the quality of the sound improved 1,000 fold.The size of the rubber ear pieces is extremely important. The bass seems absent unless the buds are fully inside ear. The only downside I see is the lack of volume control and ability to switch tracks when listening to music. Hope to have provided a helpful review.

7336,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It sounds normal in Samsung Note5 (its performance is only equal to the  performance of earphones came with Note4). In Other devices such as xperia z3, lenovo vibe x3, etc, its not that good, except rich bass sound. Its performance doesn't justify its cost.

7337,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Quality of sound is not as good as Sony XB55 or even Samsung's inbox in-earphones. As volume is levelled up above 70% sound quality starts getting rediculous. Cable quality is unacceptable. It is quiet easy to get damged. At this price consumer should not focus on brand name rather focus on quality of sound. Moreover, it doesn't not have volume rockers keys.

7338,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Hey there, I am using this earphones with My Iphone 6s plus and so far it’s been a good experience. The only problem with these earphones is that You can never hear it with volume full and they are very delicate. The problem with sound it that Your ears will bleed, as it’s sound quality is not good at full but yes if you keep it with volume at 75% it will give you an Awsome sound experience which you’ll love. At this price-range it’s a good deal. 4/5 rating for it’s sound quality at this price.

7339,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I've been using Soundmagic ES18 for about past 6 months and I find it very good value for money headphones.The Sennheiser cx275s is also  a  very good value for money headphones ,a little more stylish than the SoundMagic ES18 .Sennheiser cx275s sounds really good, even though the bass is very power it is clear and  not overpowering. You can hear sound of each and every instrument clearly.The quality of these headphones are very good and it supports mic also. When compared to the SoundMagic ES18 you can go on hearing bass overwhelmed songs for hours and it doesn't hurt your ears but SoundMagic ES18 starts hurting after sometime. These headphones also comes with a warranty of 2 years.Finally these headphones are real value for money under rupees 1500.

7340,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I ordered this item ""Sennheiser CX275 S In-Ear Universal Mobile Headphone with Mic (Black)"" hoping it would give a better output than my current earphone ""Sennheiser CX180"" but I was disappointed. The wire was too thin and delicate. The sound output was only 5 to 10 % better than CX180. I decided to return it.
",3
7341,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Fulfilled by Amazon, so packaging was good. It came in a compact packing. Quality of the audio was good.. noise cancellation was decent, though I didn't test it much except for listening to music in front of the TV or somebody talking. You can take calls and end calls with the call button. It is the only single button present there. Voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. On the main screen if you press the button, it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. If you press again, it will pause it. It is capable of capturing FM radio signals. This is tested on Samsung S3 as a headset. On apple ipad as a headphone. The volume up down buttons were not present. While some commented that it is thin (and it is compared to my stock Samsung headphone), it is not fragile.

7342,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is genuinely one of best earphone I have ever bought. It's perfect from every angle. Being a music lover, I enjoy listening music by using this earphone very much. I recommend this to anyone who wants to listen quality music listening experience. It definitely is one of the best product in this line.
",5
7343,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is my second purchase from seinnheiser brand . Previous one was cx180. So I can campare new one with that.  Sound quality is Almost same no big difference. Bass is on louder side in cx275. I heard Sony also but I think cx 275is better than Sony. nothing more special beside attached mic in cx 275. I will rewrite my review after using it for some weeks.Thanks
",4
7344,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I don't know why this product got that much good reviews, i listen for 1 or 2 hours with all the kind of sounds and finally i got to know that at this cost we can get 2 earphones with better sound. This earphone has very bad sound quality like some local product that we can get in trains of cost 50 to 100 rs only.  I really disappointed with this product.I was using sony c300 bluetooth earphone, if someone want to listen good sound just try that and compare, you will got to know.

7345,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The Quality of Sound is Great, The Design is also Good; Light Weight but the Wires are very Thin and gets Entangled and not recommended for Rough Use. One of the Ear phone got damaged (Suddenly No Sound) even when from Outside everything looked Ok.Price is also too high. Sennheiser being such a Reputed brand MUST Look into its Durability aspects; as its not a Fair Purchase spending Rs. 1900 for the use of just 8 Months. Next Time I would not Purchase it as Market offers Branded Products at 1/4th, 1/5th the Price
",3
7346,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"sound quality is good. bass and treble balance is adequate. its priced slightly on the higher side may be because of its looks and brand name. I would suggest to them to cut about 200-300 bugs on it if they want to steal the costumers away from other brands. As such one cannot see the design once they are in your ears. Built quality is good and they provide a small pouch with it to stow your earphones which is handy as it prevents it from tangling if kept just like that.
",4
7347,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pls do not buy this product.Sound is honestly good and clear, though bass is not as per expectations.Product material quality is not good at all. I read some reviews around the quality, however I thought it is to do with user handling. But when I experienced it myself, I regret buying this product. It is a very delicate, which is unexpected for headphone kind of product. And this happens within 2 months of purchase
",2
7348,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Build quality does not feel premium. I feel the wires are delicate. Sony earphones are better choice if you're looking for durable products. Sound is well balanced, high and low are clear. Vocals are clear. Clarity in sound. But if you're an EDM lover you might want to look at a different product because this earphone has sacrificed bass for clarity and balanced audio.
",4
7349,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am using this earphone since Oct 18. I saw many review about wire thickness but I didn't find any problem with that sound quality is good same as cx 213 overall good product. I don't know why senheiser used 6 year old model till now they should work on same pricing with good quality tongle free wire and good sound.
",4
7350,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Superb audio quality, amazing noise cancellation, best for travelling.The after sales service is very good got the new one within 5 minutes for my old one which got some defects after 15 months of use.The best earphone in this price range. and i will give it 5/5 for my overall experience.Thanks Sennheiser for easing my replacement for the defective one.
",5
7351,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am a repeat buyer. This is the best in ear headphone with mic at this price point. I have used other products but the voice and sound quality of the mic in this is the best. The basic sound quality of the eatlrphone is also great.
",5
7352,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"WOW is one word for this product just for the customer service . After few months of usage , one of the ear peice had issue and got it replaced with new one . Great customer service I would say .In terms sound quality it is nice as well. But the cable quality can be improved , you have to be little careful with it while using it
",5
7353,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The earphones are not comfortable the voice is too sharp to hurt ears.Can not believe that Sennheiser has these quality of earphonesGenuinely advice to buy SoundMagic.Those lasted 3 years. Everything is great.Thought that Sennheiser would be better but what a disappointment
",2
7354,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Did not live up to my expectations. After using skull candy at the same price range, this sounds too inferior in bass quality and sound output. Otherwise for an average listener it is a good choice. Light weight and comes with a nice pouch.
",3
7355,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I got this product in Feb and the sound quality has gone terrible in just half a month. It's not worth at allllll. The earphones that I got in a local store for 150 bucks worked for an year  at least. When I thought of returning it says not eligible and even though there is a warranty of 2 years and a toll free number given, its of NO USE. The toll free number doesn't even exit. Awesome Trap ... KEEP IT UP Guys..... I wish there was a half star option in the review.
",1
7356,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Awesome sound. Best quality earphones i have owned. Lightweight, best in class noise isolation, and that beautiful pouch to carry them in.Reduced 1 star in the durability section, since the wires are so thin.
",5
7357,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Excellent Sound Quality, Excellent balance of bass and trebble. Totally worth it. I have compared it with the sony one which comes around 1800 bucks and sony is no way nearer in terms the quality. I have compared it with the AKG and it gave tough competition. But, sennheiser was little good. Then I compared it with apple eaphones. In this apple earphones had better quality in sound.
",5
7358,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I love Music with some bass. Sennheiser CX 2.0G is good over all . Nice soothing sound, comfortable, you can distinguish almost each cord and beat. But one thing it lacks Bass, Bass is just better than phone speaker.  If you are not Bass lover then its awesome earphone in 2K.  I found wire may not sustain longer life and it's also not tangle free. thats a disappointment taking other earphones available in this range.
",4
7359,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I all ready use CX180 and now I buy CX275.I pay 850 rp for CX180 and 1600 rp for CX275.I want to say there is no doubt that sound quality is very good of sennheiser.Now I buy CX275. But i found no difference in both earphone. Same sound quality in both lead. So friend don't waste your money.
",4
7360,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"For first few days i was really disappointed. The headphones sounded cheap. I actually thought to go for sony again. But after a week suddenly it started to sound great. Bass is good and punchy but not at all overpowering. Treble is fine. Vocals are very very clear. Well it is not comparable to my previous headphone ie sony mdr xb70.but  it is good and very comfortable. Surround sound is quite good and noise cancellation works ok, though i felt that the sound is tweaked in some places and certainly is not for a purist. But, overall at this price this is really a good headphone.
",4
7361,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Its average headset - we can use this for day to day purpose.Don't expect Bose kind of features in this however sound quality is good. For regular use or rough and touch use, we can use. The product quality is also good. Past one year, I am using this, I've not seen any problems.I will definitely recommend this product, value for money.
",3
7362,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Amazing sound quality, clear and punchy bass. Good mids. And treble that doesn't bleed your ears! Light to use and comfortable for prolonged use as well. Low impedance, thus low power draw and loud volume. Inline mic is good quality, for calls only tough! Comes with a carrying pouch, do use it! It is not completely tangle free, but is fine.
",5
7363,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I bought two earphones one with mic one with out mic on 27march19 , it's not even 2 months properly the left earphone doesn't work for one The other one is not working properly either ,  There is a loose connection with the wiring , one doesn't work at all all the other I have to keep adjusting the wire it's so annoying .never expected this from a brand like Sennheiser , very disappointed
",1
7364,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Is this sennheiser earphone original and genuine product? I got this product yesterday and im trying to check authenticity on sennheiser website. But its failing to confirm the authentication! Which leads to question, is this a genuine product? But sound quality output is fine. But what about my earphone warranty?
",3
7365,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This earphone is good when it comes to sound quality although bass is little low. But in my situation it’s 3.5mm jack is not so good after 4,5 months of usage i was sometimes not able to listen from my left earpiece but after rotating headphone jack a little bit it was okay and then the mic problem also. I don’t know why but durability of this product is not so good
",3
7366,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bought them in January 2018 but now only left side workingConsidering the fact that I am a kind of rough user they lasted well (not even a single one of which I bought earlier lasted more than a couple of months) but not that good compared to its priceSound is clear thoughBass is just fine
",3
7367,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not that much satisfiedBuilt quality is not good, the mic has a loose button which looks like it's gonna fall off.After spending 1600 bucks , quite disappointed with the manufacturer...Sound quality is fine...Previously I was using JBL...I think my next buy will be JBL now.
",3
7368,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Product cost is more.  This product is not value for money for the price which we pay. The quality of the wire also looks substandard.  Once if the wire gets damaged we have to keep running for warranty to hear unnecessary comments.  Instead its better to go to boat 225 hands free and its half the price of the Senehiser CS-275 S. One can cooly get more than what you pay for Boat 225 in-ear hands free.
",3
7369,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Initially the sound quality and voice quality were great.  But within 6 months one of the speakers stopped working.  And amazon doesn't give 1 year warranty,  the brand does.  So,  have to visit customer care of Sennheiser.  Makes you think to buy such products offline rather than online.
",1
7370,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Usually plug type earphones don't give much bass which is standard for all brands not matter how big or small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised by the bass. I wasn't looking forward to it much while buying since I know plugs aren't effective bass wise. It's great. I also have another  Sennheiser, same-ish specifications but they aren't plugs, and this one does a 10% better job than that.PS: I'm a Sennheiser lad so my review may be baised (or not). But they are just better than expensive Sony (bass reflex) etc that I've used in the past.
",5
7371,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This headphone is having really very Good sound (Clear and crispy) it doesn't have rich bass.The one who love normal sound without any rich bass and equalizer they will find this awesome.This headphone is having very good noice cancellation.Just you need to take care of wire which is very thin.Box packing is really good.
",4
7372,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is good but along this I got an extension plug which is defect even after return, without extension the sound is very good... I give rating because of poor quality check...
",3
7373,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using use headphones for four years and after few years only I had some issues on the headphones I was not hearing on my left side but if the two was working fine but sometimes I had the tissue and internal event for the same product and the warranty they give is really good you get the replacement warranty for 2 years definitely go for this headphones
",5
7374,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Superior sound quality. excellent Bass. Ossome. Comfortable in Ear. there is no pain in the ear while using. you can use it for a long time in the ear you will no fill any kind of pain in the ear.
",5
7375,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The material quality of the product, has a problem of getting tangled, followed by the tensions occuring in the joints like in the mix and thus the durability lacks. The sound quality is good enough with proper noise cancellation but my product's sound quality detoriated along with its age and suddenly a day, the earphone was one live and one dead by the end of 6 months. Plus it's long head near the 3.5mm jack, makes it problematic to keep it in the pockets.
",3
7376,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The quality of the product isn’t good at all. Build and make quality is good, but the noise cancellation & other aspects aren’t good.
",3
7377,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"As I'm using this since month Didn't expected this from Sennheiser , very bad sound quality, sound level need to raise it till 70-80% then I can here it clearly, less bass . Not at all premium product as per price. Earlier I used Cx-686 for more than 2 years which is really good product..but with CX 2.0g dispointed
",2
7378,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"There is no headphones which can stand against this one it has super good noise cancellation and bass quality the only thing it lacks in is the wire thickness and the port plug which starts to rip off after a year
",4
7379,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"So its been 3 days now when product got delivered, and from last 3 days I'm using these headphones regularly... I used these for 3-4 hrs continously but even after 4 hours you can comfortably continue to listen even more, it's very comfortable for long hour of usage also. Sound quality is perfect and is upto the mark, 5 stars for that. Lows mids and high are very clear. Go for it guys, nice pair of earphones from sennheiser.
",5
7380,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound Quality wise these earphones do their job 5☆ excellent.I am giving 3☆ because of1) The wires are very very thin2) There should be some ruf-n-tuf joint at all 3 points (at earpieces and jack)3) Volume up and down keys are not there. If you are listening to music you have to take mobile out of your pocket everytime you want to adjust volume.
",3
7381,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First off, its senneisher. And they're flat frequency response earphones. So the sound quality, so if you're into true sound then these earphones are good enough and plus being in-ear earphones, the lower frequencies stay inside the cave of your ear.
",4
7382,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is the second time I am buying this because I was surprised how good and well the first pair lasted me...had to buy again because I lost it somewhere.... seriously...the level of comfort and sound quality are too good for its price.Don't go on its looks...it is durable easy to handle...also Bass is very good there is no dedicated noise cancellation setup or something (how vould be at this price) Best earphones under 5000k
",5
7383,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Earphones were delivered in good condition and the sound quality is just awesome. Bought this as a replacement for my Sony xbr50 earphones.Only concern is that the cord is very thin and feels a little feeble.. Not sure how many days it gonna withstand
",5
7384,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have used Sony, JBl earphones previously and both were very good. This pair of Senheiser earphones are just perfect for me. I felt the its the best all rounder i owned. Go for it without a second thought.
",5
7385,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I had lost one pair of CX 275 which I had bought from Croma. So I had no questions about its quality. Although between the stock earphones that one gets with the Iphone those compared to the CX 275 - was a pretty much head to head...Ive heard that the apple ones come at around 2,300/- so a set of CX275 at 1500/- is a steal ...also I bought it during some offer at 1300 or 1400 rs.Yes they have very thin wires but have never got any durability issue with the wire.Just be careful of the jack ... the neck of the 3.5 pin is kind of strong but its better to be careful.I am technically challenged to give a feedback in terms of mids and lows and highs and blows blah blah
",4
7386,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I've used Sennheiser before. This has more than decent sound quality. But the biggest turn off is that it doesn't come with volume control on wire. Only one button is provided that connects/disconnect the call and Plays/pause music. For controlling volume you'll need to take out the phone every single time. That's a big let off for me.
",3
7387,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"At this price I expected some magic. Don't expect. Sound is excellent, you can enjoy even at low volume and long use.
",4
7388,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"After through research & my Friends recommendation I made my mind to purchase CX 275s from Sennheiser within my budgetThe Sennheiser CX 275s is a good headset for someone who wants microphone functionality and Bass response is very well and I can say its better than JBL
",5
7389,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound quality is really good. No distortion. No proble amazing. The material used is not very strong so i would not recommend using it roughly. If you use it properly and take care of it properly, it would really last long. You should buy it if you are a casual music listener.
",4
7390,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is one of the best earphones in terms of sound quality bass is superb and also mids and highs are truly reproduced. I have been using it for 5 years but still no competitor stands against it. Love u Sennheiser...!!!
",5
7391,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The Best headset I have used. Will continue to use same only.Pros :1. Very ergonomic and comfortable to wear.2. Very clear sound clarity on call as well as Music.3. Noice cancellation is handled well.4. Value for money.5. Handy carry case to keep it safe while traveling.Cons :1. You may not like it if prefer more bass or woofer effect.
",5
7392,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is my 4th sennheiser product over the years and I really like its sound quality, not exactly as the premium Sennheiser headphones which deliver a unique sound. This one is bassier. Small, extremely light weight and a microphone that works well. Although I feel its not durable due to the plasticky built but nothing happened so far.
",4
7393,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If what you want is quality sound with well differentiated mids and highs and a moderate amount of bass, Not overpowering, but the right amount for a song as such. Then get this. Not for extra bass lovers. The fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. But what matters is the sound quality, The latency is almost non existent on the microphone button, atleast on my phone anyway. No microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. This is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. That speaks about the sound reproduction on the Sennheiser headsets.
",5
7394,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First of all i wanted to say that Sennheiser customer care service is awesome they just replace your product if it didn't have any physical damage., Very rare company replace your defective product hand to hand in just 2 3 minutes.I think this cx275 s have some mic issue other people did complaint that your voice is not clear.
",4
7395,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I'm a little confused over which side goes in which ear, as there's no marking for L and R. The output is nice, but has to be pushed inside the ear a little more than normal earphones to get the proper bass output and quality of sound.
",3
7396,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have bought the earphone and faced issue of mirophone. Even after replacing the earphone facing the same issue. It looks like this is default problem in all the headsets maybe manufacturing defect. Please provide feedback to company. There is a delay in changing tracks using microphone button. Also, the earphones do not work while answering the calls for the first time. It works while answering the call second time.
",1
7397,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I used it for 2. 5 years before it stopped working. Sound quality is very good. However sometimes you might find some sounds tinny or muddy. But the journey was enjoyable. Go for it.

7398,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Guys don't be hesitate to get this In - Ear👂 Phone. It's really an excellent product I'm n't exaggerating it i had used and still using the same earphone 🎧 from last 1.6Yrs on My Samsung Galaxy S5.. it's reaally a awesome Earphone by Snehheiser Brand.. no Doubt. Still I've not faced any issue/problem with this product.. i always Love to hear Songs in thi earphones. Its worth! GO FOR IT.
",5
7399,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Dude it's an perfect headphone for a music lover..with every thing under control like bass n all..and above that i got 1 year warranty from sennhiser and they did really replace the complete unit.
",5
7400,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The wire is too thin. So if you live in a place like Mumbai and you travel in trains a lot, this headphones might rip easily. sound quality is great for price. Bass is heavy and feels the right amount. The problem I faced with my OnePlus 5 is that the headphone connector is too big for the 3.5mm jack. Due to which, it keeps on poping out and getting disconnected within a few seconds of putting in.
",3
7401,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pros: Sound qualityCons: when u plugin into 3.5 mm slot,u are forced to make minor/minute adjustments for the mic and speaker to work.Sometimes you have to bend the wire near the pin to hear the voiceMy another friend bought this and he too experiences the samePremium pricing
",2
7402,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"i used cx180...then i bought this..but i didn't get that much satisfaction with this... treble is dominant on sound...there is bass ...but treble is extra
",4
7403,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Writing review after one year of usage. Left side of the earphones has stopped working. And there is no way to claim warranty. They don't have service center even in a city like Chandigarh. Only service available in North India is in Gurgaon. So even if it works good. But the moment you face any problem there is no redressal system.
",2
7404,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Using since 18 months. Very satisfied with the wire quality and sound quality as well. Don't think twice this is the best thing available. Earbuds are so comfortable that i used for 6- 7 hrs continuously without any problem. Love this product.
",5
7405,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"When I read the reviews before purchasing this headphone I found some Great reviews but after buying that and now been using it for more than 3 weeks I can tell you it is not worth the money that pays the sound quality is just a little bit above  ok.
",3
7406,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Had to reorder this because old ones weren't durable enough near the audio jack. I have a rough and tough use, so, once I pulled the wire to remove jack, the connections got loose.Very nice audio quality and material quality.
",5
7407,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using these earphones for almost 2years now, sound quality is unmatched for the price, very clear, very comfortable to wear long hours & do not hurt the ears, noise cancellation would depend on the volume that you would listen to music, best part is even at high volumes the music is still very clear, would recommend these to anyone who want to buy wired earphones.
",5
7408,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great set of earphones. The sound quality is beautiful. Unfortunately, sennheiser has compromised on the build quality of the earphones. A few months down the line, one side has stopped working. The 3.5mm plug in is really flimsy and the wire is poor. You pay a lot of money and end up with poor quality. It's disappointing. The sound, however, is wonderful. If only the build quality was better.
",2
7409,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's a steal deal as you get much more than what you pay for. The sound quality is great. The set's design is also excellent! I would recommend this product to those who are looking for a daily- general use. No complaints, except for the earphone's wires being thin. I reckon if that would be a problem in the future.
",5
7410,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The hedphones are very niceI had dropped the headphones in a buclet of water for abput 3 hours before realizing that i had dropped it I then tied the headphones to my bike for another 4 hours to dry it off and it still worked and was really happy that it did . Has great sound quality as well . Was happy to shop at amazon and will continue to do so
",5
7411,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I received this product in a day which is the fastest I've ever received any order from Amazon at. Really happy with the earphones and sound quality is absolutely amazing. I owned a pair of sennheiser  cx180s which is still as great as new which I purchased in July 2015 last year. I must say that the durability of sennheiser earphones is marvellous as I tried using the skullcandy earphones before and they wouldn't survive for even  last 3 months. After the first listen to a song, I could make out how the bass is boosted in the 275s and the notes as super clear. So happy! Totally worth the money. And I'm glad I upgraded to this. I'm a total sennheiser fan!
",5
7412,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I bought this earphones to replace my original iPhone 7 Plus earphones. They are just amazing and too comfortable to use all day long without hurting your ears. The sound quality is very good.

7413,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not much noisy. Neat sound and comfortable earbuds. I have been using this product an year approx. no problem. I shred this it to my pocket everyday when I go office. Wire quality is also good.
",5
7414,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is a below average product from Senheiser. Expected more from them. Totally let down. If you enjoy good sound quality sound- DO NOT BUY this product. You’re better off with a (can’t believe I’m actually saying this) BOAT earphones. Even they have a more balanced sound profile than the CX.This was bad. Really bad. Expectations were let down. Days were made to crap.Don’t buy this.

7415,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have used every piece of headphones But man im gonna really appreciate these the most.Don't think twice to buy this.Better than skull jbl sony and many others available on amazon.Price JustifiedQuality AmazingTotally Worth Buying.. ✌

7417,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Got them for traveling since I couldn't take my Audio Technicas along with me, they sound great, bass isnt that strong.I've heard a lot about Sony's and their bass response. I personally couldn't get hands on a pair so I can't compare but no matter what you listen, in my experience bass is important.I'll recommend these to someone with a budget of under Rs 2000, but try to listen to Sony's once as I've heard their better before purchasing.Shipping is horrible, took more than a week. Unless amazon is the cheapest, buy from somewhere else. Amazon does has an excellent return service and they accept returns if you are not satisfied by the quality, used this to try different earphones and this pair is what I'm keeping.

7418,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Quality is good .Pouch is really convenient . The sound quality is good ,not great.But for this price range it is worth it.The downside is the really flimsy wire ,which is the reason i regret buying it now.
",3
7419,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound is awesome! I used it for 2 years. The wire is thin. It started to peel off recently. May be it's due to my heavy rugged use. A great product but.I'll buy this again.

7420,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Mind blowing shipping by Amazon. Delivered to me 2 days before the estimated date.The product is absolutely tremendous. Sound quality is beautiful. I'm writing this just after listening to the product. Call button is very sturdy. I've been a Hardcore Sony user. Love Sony for detail in the sound. But this baby impressed me a lot. First ever Sennheiser product & it is absolute magnificent. Very light in the ear. Can't even feel if its there. Bass is really really good. Pouch given with it is a quality product. I use it for EDM mainly & it does the job perfectly.
",5
7421,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound is very good, product also good but I don't know why right ear phone is not working.... This shows how much durability and quality of it this product. Very unhappy to share this. Given 2 years warranty. Need to be sent to Bengaluru. Its been irritating.
",2
7422,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nice product with completely packed. Sound effect is outstanding compared to other ear phone. Bass quaility is really good. Compatible with most of the smart phones. Great product from Amazon with nice packing. If you are looking for some real sound effects, you should go for it. I am recommending this product over other models line CX 180 and CX 215 because it comes with mic also which is very useful.
",4
7423,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound is fantastic.Plastic body and the wire are durable and light weight.I didn't not like the ear buds. Among 3 pairs,I felt the 2 larger sizes are almost the same.

7424,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"+ Very comfortable in ear for long hours and overall an all round performer. You will get great base by adjusting the equalizer setting in the player app.- The wire strength is on weak side.
",5
7425,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good quality earphones with flexible listening range. Can be used for music, movies, online videos etc. Been using the samr model from Sennheiser for many years. They have made these more sturdy now. Good purchase. Recommended for anyone looking for a good set of earphones for daily use.

7426,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Points for material quality-3 out of 5,sounds quality-4.5/5.0,durability 4/5. Conclusion:- must buy for bass lover. Clarity of sound is good but not best. Good for this price range:)
",5
7427,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Material quality is very bad and hence the durability is 6 months for hardcore pubg players. The sound quality is the best in this price range. I am trying go claim the warranty but the shipping charges are high from my place and in their policy they say that wear and tear damage are not under warranty and hence i am afraid that the will deny my claim and i will lose my shipping money.
",3
7428,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I bought it in April 2017. It worked well for the past 2 years but now recently the mic stopped working. And since the warranty period is now over I am forced to buy a new earphone. Probably will now go for a cheaper one.
",2
7429,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good pair of headphones. If you want something that work for a whole year, go ahead and buy these. If you're looking for something that lasts a but longer, look elsewhere.They sound great for the one year that they're going to last for. I had bought 2 of these. One for me and one for my girlfriend. Both of them went bad in a year.

7430,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I brought this item during lightning deal (around 1350).I have used Skullcandy ink'd and Skullcandy inkd'2 (too much treble and suppressed mids) in the past and i can safely say that these earphones are far superior to those in terms of balanced sound.Pros:1.These have a nice soundstage (9/10)2.Just the right amount of lows, mids, and highs (10/10).3.Noise cancellation on these is extremely good (9.5/10)4.Universal mic (comes with a converter if doesn't work directly with your mobile)5.If you are looking for very good bass, you'll love these (9.5/10).Cons:1.The cables look and feel fragile.My current equipment - these and Audio Technica M50X.
",5
7431,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"As a headphone to listen music its a very nice buy. But the major con of the product is its mouth piece. The mouth piece should have been more closer to the mouth. Everytime you try to speak to someone you have to hold the mouth piece closer. And there is no hook as well to clutch it on your cloth.Apart from this all is good.
",3
7432,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pro1. Very good sound2. Shape is perfect and 👂 cup fitted in ear perfectly3. Bass and treble is balanced.Con.1. Very thin wire so entangled easily and difficult.2. If I pay this amount than it should have volume button.

7433,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great sound quality, best part is that it totally blocks any outside noise, delight to use even on airplanes. Pouch provided but would have been best to have a wire manager.
",5
7434,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"What can I tell about the product.I initially ordered the product and got it replace because it was not working properly.Later I ordered it again assuming that I will receive a good quality product. However post month the new earphone that I received stopped functioning.I had to visit the Service center and get it replaced.Not expected such type of product from Amazon
",1
7435,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Using for 6 months. No problems as of now. Satisfied with the build quality (rough use). Microphone is crisp and clear. You can't expect a better all rounder sound quality at this price. Best suited for EDM, pop, rap etc. If you prefer Classical, and clarity over bass, I'd suggest to go with a higher end audio technica over Sennheiser. Ciao!

7436,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Received delivery of the earphone 1 hour ago.Guys I can't stop listining to my playlists now.Previously I owned Skull candy smokin buds 2.This is way better than 👆.Sound quality further increases after a week or few days of usage.Can't wait to experience the final results.Paisa pura wasool.Will update after a month or so😎

7437,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using this product since 2 years and I was very much satisfied and I bought this again and I am still satisfied with it.I will definitely suggest this product because its worth every single penny you spend on it.It has a long duration and the best part is the sound,its just amazing.The quality is also good.I would just say,just go for it.
",5
7438,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is amazing product from Sennheiser. I am using it from last one year sound qualities of this headphone is superb, before a cell phone find using Sennheiser CX 180 Street II compare to that best headphone quality is Good and it comes with mic
",5
7439,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It didn't last even for 2 month. I was very disappointed with the product as it stopped working suddenly despite good maintenance. I  always use Sennheiser's headphones. I think the product that I received is a duplicate one
",1
7440,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Recieved this just now.Its nice and all but the small L-shaped connector they gave in the box is not working properly.When connected through l shaped connector the sound is only coming in one earbud and not the other but when connected directly the sound is available in both so i don't know whether i should ask for a replacement or just ignore that l shaped connector.
",4
7441,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"One of the best in ear headphones available in the market. The name is Sennheiser and it symbolises Quality Audio. As a general music lover, all I can say is it is awesome. Coreectly produces all the ranges of sound spectrum. Though it doesn't has very high bass but it is balanced.Music comes out crystal clear and it doesn't pain in the ear after long duration of listening music.
",5
7442,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Well I'm not gonna describe them in detail. Get the thing cleared that, product delivered is genuine and is awesome. All layers of song are clearly audible, whether you listen to EDMs or Rock or Pop. They won't dissapoint you. You'll know what the real bass is when you'll use these earphones. Pause/Play and Previous/Next track option is also supported. Pouch is handy. Quality is great.To test any earphones, for bass listen to ""G6, Lil John- Bass terror, Bassnector- Empathy"", For Bass+Treble "" Skrillex -Kill everybody vs Ruffneck"", for filtering ""Adventure Club - Kaboom, Bloodletting""  ... In price range of 2K, only these earphones will not dissapoint you. I'm in love with them.
",5
7443,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best earphones ever & even Sony, JBL, Skullcandy etc can't even match or compared with Sennheiser brand  overall performance is great but which one is right and left note mentioned on earphones dat not a problem & with Dolby Atmos sounds great 👌👍
",5
7444,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Initially performance was good. But one ear piece stopped working within 15 months of use ! Its too early to break down such an expensive ear phone from a reputed brand...not expected at all.
",2
7445,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I thought the 'senheiser' name was enough but utterly disappointed afer using it. I don't know if i received a used product or what but the music quality was extremely poor. My apple earbuds, even my moto earphones are far more better. Never gonna trust a brand again without using it first.
",1
7446,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Highly satisfied from the bass, sound quality and noise cancellation. Design is too good and impressive. Its not getting tangled. I am recommending go for it dont think twice. I did same day delivery and i got it within 16hrs of ordering... For this earphone just one word- WOWW..
",5
7447,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"CX 180 is far better than CX 275s. First of all CX 275 is not fit well in ear and Mic quality is also very poor for which Amazon charging  at list Rs. 900 Extra. You can buy twice CX 180 in the price of CX 275 and also save some money. CX275 has very thin wire that sound very cheap. I recommend not to Buy CX275s.
",1
7448,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These are good ear phones. But to be honest, I wouldn't say that these are way better than Apple EarPods. EarPods has its own classy features to this. At the same time, this earphones have very good noise attenuation features really. I have got these for around ₹1513, which is a very good deal and they are worth the bucks I have shelled out.
",5
7449,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Wow! Just wow. Haven’t used any earphones that fit in my ears better than these ones. Sound good, everything good. For me, the fit has been the biggest challenge always and these win hands down.
",4
7450,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"In the name of noise cancellation it it just a freek. It just fits good in ears doesn't cansel noise. Wire should have been made of better quality to avoid tangelling. In the price range that it is being sold.
",5
7451,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser service is great....I bought this product in July 2016 but unfortunately, it got damaged due to a manufacturing defect. I contacted customer service through the toll-free number. They said to courier the product with the bill to Bangalore as it the only nearest service center to me (Chennai). I couriered it as they informed and within 5 days I got a new Sennheiser CX 275 S. THANKS, alot Sennheiser.
",4
7452,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound quality is very nice. The material is also good, have just started using it, so have to see after an year, the build quality. Would update the review again then.
",4
7453,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Noise reduction ?---------- A BIG YES. @ 1300 bucks in 'Amazon lightning deals' which would otherwise be 2000 bucks at any other website, it was definitely a steal. 100% loud applause for Amazon for making this real.Product:- Thumping basses + sizzling trebles.....nothing much out of proportion or distorted. I am not a technical buff nor have I done any course in musicology but I have had at least a dozen headsets from various makers in the past  and can assure that this thing is a beast. Again, don't always blame the hardware. The same song at 96 kbps and 320 kbps sound different through the same gadget. I cannot afford a Bose but this thing is definitely way better than my native Samsung/Nokia headsets.
",5
7454,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using this for almost 2 years now. I have tried so many earphones on the last 10 years.... But none come even close to the quality you get with this one. Exceptional clarity and superb responsive in both low and high frequencies.Each time you put it on, you can feel the difference.
",5
7455,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Overall pretty good.Complete noise cancellation is not expected at this price range anyway. But it does reduce some background noise.Earbubs fit quite well. Would not fall off during workout. Build quality is also very nice.Sound quality is very good at this price range although it lacks the punchy bass that some prefer.
",4
7456,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This item has been quite good. I have tried JBL, House of Marley, Sony and Philips earphones, but this one leaves all competition behind. But of late, I am facing problems with the product. One side of the earphone is not working. Since the product is still in the warranty period, I would like to know how to get this repaired/replaced. There is no email ID/contact detail of Cloudtail India Private Limited.
",5
7457,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This product is amazing. The Sound quality just awesome full balanced vocal, tune, bass, treble all such things are fully balanced. HIGH LOW MID level all are just fabulous you can hear all sounds in a track. But the build quality compared to this price range it should be better than other product.
",5
7458,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"As usual the Sennheiser rocks. Tried throwing different genre and it surpasses my expectation in all. After a lot of confusion between sony xb series and sennheiser cx series, I decided to go for sennheiser. This can become a perfect travel buddy cancelling all the surrounding noise.The package comes with steps to authenticate your earphone on official website. It is genuine. I also contacted sennheiser customer care just to do another round of review and they also confirmed the authenticity.I am deducting a star because the cable is very thin and you need to take extra care of this product to avoid cable damage (just my thought). It is also compatible with lumia, xperia, moto and iPhone.Again, its an amazing earphone below 2K.

7459,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First the quality of bass and treble it produces is very good. Perfectly fits in the ear.Pros:-1) Excellent Bass2)Crystal Clear sound3)Outstanding Noise Cancelletion4)Great mic quality5)Inclusion of Pouch is good6)2 years warranty is like icing on the cakeCon:-The only con is that the cable quality.

To say about the product, awesome product for this awesome price. I got it just for 1364 bucks, which is nothing when compared to the quality of the sound and other features. The ear phone gels well with Ipod and other apple products when compared to other Android devices.

7469,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Awesome sound quality! I love it :-)The box contains my CX275s, two extra earbuds (one large, one small pair), carry pouch.I just listened one song on this, would update more later.EDIT: They worked for 2 years straight on. This is really good. I purchased on 29 Aug 2015 and only around Oct 2017 it started having issues with one earphone not giving sound. It cost me Rs.1791 for 2 years, that is Rs. 2.4875 per day. Any other Rs. 500 earphone would have started giving issues in 6 months which would be costlier. The sound quality is really good. I am not a bass-head, I don't want my eaphones to boom base. I like music, and these are perfect. They don't focus on base. These earphones got pulled on many times, when I thought these would be done. They got twisted. It suffered through all that and didn't stop working. So it's durable.

7470,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is excellent. All the highs and lows are sharp and clear.You can hear the every single instrument clearly.Only drawback is its wire, which seems too feeble. build quality is decent(Not great).Mic doesn't work with my Lenevo Thinkpad for some reason.

7473,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Everything is good but price is little high. Same doing we get in 1k in other brands.Only good thing is it has two years warranty that's it.Thinking two take refund and order other brand..There is an extra jack with this earphone but both the jacks are not working with one plus 6..And the noise cancellation is not that good..

7474,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The mids and highs are very clear and bass is decent in short the songs doesn't appear muddy as I can distinguish the mids hugs and lows that's the best thing about em but one thing I don't like is the quality idk it appears quite basic but still can't say about it as it's working fine till now just appears cheap.

7475,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser has the best warranty in the market, they even replace the physically damaged piece in just five minutes(only bill is required). Best sound quality is complemented by the amazing warranty(just they have only service centers in Delhi and Mumbai in India.). Go for it,best value for money. Writing this review after using these earphones for 2 years.

7478,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Select the cushions right and you are in for a treat. I ordered one and found the bass flat in contrary to the reviews -  I returned it - Since its Amazon fulfilled - it was hassle free - Ordered an another one as I highly trust Sennheiser products and thought the 1st one was a manufacturing defect - Got the second one and found the bass to be meh however this time I opened the entire package and switched to the largest cushion which instantly transformed the entire experience, you instantly switch to a club experience...

7480,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"awesome sounds. Found it to be slightly better than the SoundMagic E10C. cx275s has better bass and better sound isolation than e10c. But i hate the wires of the cx275s. Also, i miss the accessories of the e10c.

7481,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"AWESOMMMMMMEEEEEBought this from Cloudtail, Good quality and fast delivery. Coming to the Headphones, These are Bassy. One of the best pairs I own till date. I have owned Sony, Samsung, HTC, Lenovo, Beats and my previous best earphones the MI Pistons 2.I used to think the Piston had some good Bass and clarity but after hearing the Sennheiser cx275s, Am just in Aw. And the best part is that the performance is out of the box, The headphones will get better with play.You can hear individual bass beats and it sounds nice. Also the Mids are good(Not best but still pretty nice). Highs are also pretty nice.ONLY CON:The Wires seem very Fragile. Too thin.Mic seems ok quality. But You buy these cx for their sound quality so who cares about the mic
",5
7482,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Weak cables. Looks and feels delicate. Build quality is not worth the $$. The mic on this one died within two months of use. Disappointed as i expected that it would last me for 6 months for the least. Audio is decent although you can find better for half it's price.

7483,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is very good but it is costly and built quality is noy robust. wires are not at par with brand name. 2 yeras warranty is offered.

7484,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is superb... The wire/cable doesn't get tangled so easily... It's also sturdy.. I have been using it for over six months now..

7485,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"No doubt the sound quality of earphones are very good but the built quality is average..you have to handle it with care ..wire are sought of cheap quality, very delicate..otherwise its a best earphones
",4
7486,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The Sennheiser CX275 S is an excellent earphone with very good sound quality. The brand is doing a justice for the sound clarity and the bass of any song provided. The only cons is that the wire quality is not so very strong and seems tangle very much which makes it quite delicate to handle when kept inside the pocket. Since it is priced higher, the quality of the wire can be changed.Otherwise, the earphones is a good buy.
",4
7487,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good bass though not top notch but at this price point it can't get better than this i suppose. Sound quality at high and lows are good and there is no distortion. The carrying case provided with it is a nice. I got it for 1500 and it's worth the money.

7488,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am just loving listening Sennheiser CX 275. Every instruments of music/song is clear and distinct, base is there and it is as it should be, enough to enjoy without feeling hurt. It has proper and clear treble. lows, mid and high are all clear, constant and smooth. Base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high. I am enjoying listening at every level of volume. Under Rs. 2000/-, the best bye !

7489,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Really liked the product - good and well worth the price - however within 2 months- the left side got frayed and now i get nothing on that side:(

7490,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is the second time i bought this model as 1st one got accidentally damaged in my hand. The sound quality is awesome and the right amount of bass is set. It comes with an extension (L shape connector) which is a must if you always keep your phone in pocket. But the extension piece is not compatible with my OnePlus 6.

7491,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have a collection of various headphones, but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.I regularly listen music in my Moto G 1st gen, and I am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. I, may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced, precise audio output capabilities.Headsets I have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy, audio not clear, bulky2) Creative ep630 - less bass, short wire, less warm sound3) Nokia wh205 - very good audio output, slightly bassy, not crystal clear sound as sennheiser, wire don't tangles.4) Cowon em1 - at par with Nokia wh205. Slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought  cannot beat sennheiser, but 2nd best, good balance, not very loud, good cable, but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-Pros- good balance between bass and treble, lows are clear and crisp, quite loud, very comfortable, excellent noise isolation, nice bagCons- slightly excess treble, mids not perfect, wires get tangled, cables are thin.There is hardly any headphone without any limitations, still I must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. I will purchase another one.

7492,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"As mentioned in several other reviews, this is a good earphone.I bought this based on some reviews that mentioned about excellent noise isolation.My experience is that the audio is a bit low on bass, and provides noise isolation just about as much a local 100rupee in ear phone.Also, the wires are tangle prone.

7493,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Loved the clarity of the headphone. The sound is clear & comfortable to wear for long duration.Cons1. No tangle free wires2. Product is very fragile

7496,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Everything is just so good. Love the sound. Using it in a day-to-day life, just working fine. Worth the purchase! Durability got 4 star because of the wire, It feels weak. So just have to use it gently. Overall it's a perfect choice!

7497,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Writing this review after using it for 3yrs. This is the best in-ear earphones I've been using so far. Bass is great and the best voice clarity. Only con is the missing of volume control that's the reason i gave only 4 stars.

7498,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Everything is good. I can’t mention about bass because I didn’t really experience it. I’m Missing the volume adjustment button for my preference

7499,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very poor quality sound that becomes harsh with slight increase in volume. Total waste of money. Mi headphone worth 599 is much better.

7501,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is my second Sennheiser headphone. Using it from past 1 year. it does not get tangled easily. Comes with a pouch. Sound quality is very good. Love it and have recommended also to couple of friends. My friend also have bought it and they loved the product.

7502,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using Sennheisers for a long time, I love the sound which comes from them. It's the same Sennheiser sound, good bass, balanced and well tuned. Don't depend on the wires as it looks very flimsy, always keep them in the pouch and don't sleep wearing them

7503,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"My Favorite One, Best is Bass,Sound Clarity and Warranty, i have refereed so many friends, i have purchase two timesi have using nearly 3 years. I got one time replacement.Rate is little bit high compare to other brand. But, It is worth for long term use.

7504,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very disappointed sound quality not good no bass it hurts when u turn on the volume on full.. very poor performance. I was previously using Sennheiser CX 180 Street II In-Ear Headphone (Black), without Mic. They are much much better than these headphones.. this not they way put a mic in Ur headphone increase the price and lowers the quality

7505,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The best earphones of this category. Even while traveling by bus or train one could avoid the external noise. The mic serves the best purpose while attending the calls.
",5
7506,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"As far as sound and clarity is concerned it's scored high, so no worries while u r in call.... Only problem I faced is its bass is not so good... Previously I had HTC earphones which has better bass... Else could have got 4 star

7507,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"So-So..... I was using xperia stock Mh750 ACIA  in ear that comes with Z2. Mh750 has a deeper bass. And I have sony mdr30 as well, although mdr30 suppress everything due to extra bass and it's not good but it has a mild treble which sooth my ear. Anyway its upto people what they like.Edit 2: after 5hr burn, bass feels good, but treble is a bit harsh still.

7508,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not good bass. Clear sound. Noise cancellation is amazing.Great for taking business calls.
",3
7509,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Awesome design. Ergonomic. Sound quality is as expected .. sennheiser right ! The 4 star is because the sound is leaning towards treble which kinda surprised me because I chose  sennheiser for their bass quality. Overall sound is great though.

7510,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Man..I loved these earpiece..This is a must have thing..bass and music quality thumbs up man..Basically I don't give product reviews..but this product quality forced me to do this..Go for it blindly..Review Based on one day use..don't know for what time these piece gonna keep up with me but whatever..Iam loving and gonna love them..
",5
7511,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Crystal clear sound with Pure Bass..It's just WOW... Trust me you won't feel down after buying this.. these are a master piece. Sennheiser showed that you can get a fully loaded earphones under just 1.6K...
",5
7512,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Well it has good features and surely isn't waste of money if you look for not so bassy sound experience and good music with ecstatic instrumental... however highs can be more higher but it's still more than average can do

7513,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"received a falulty product , so ordered a replacement.replacement product is working perfactly fine,i love this product this is 3 rd time i purchased this earphone because i love its sound quality but it works max to max 1.5 yrs,after that you have to exchange it in warranty.the sound of Sennheiser is awesome.
",4
7514,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I was confused between Sony MDR xb30ex and these earphones. But I was getting Sennheiser at Rs.1300  in sale so I ordered them.Looks : they look niceBuild quality:the wire is very thin but not  fragile.Still you have to be careful.Sound: with EDM songs you are doing in another world . For hip hop the base is just as much needed.They actually sound beautiful with every genre.Lastly let me say under Rs.2000 buying these pair will be your best decision.And for price I got Rs.1300 I think I cannot be more lucky to own them.
",5
7515,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Though the consignment was received well in time, the product does not meet the standards mentioned on the site. Its a normal headset. With no additional bass ( Which actually what I was looking for). 7 Out of 10 times the call receiving button does not functions. I have to use my cell phone to receive or end the call.  The ear plugs fit properly, and does not slips out and feels comfortable for long listening hours. Sound is not incredible but its just above the normal ones.
",3
7516,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The CX275s is a really market worthy earphone. The bass is amazing, you can clearly feel the pounding of the beats. The vocals is crisp and clear and does not interfere with any other sounds. Movies, songs, games, calls, radio all sound amazing.The noise cancellation is pretty amazing. I have had trouble with in-ear pieces on the Apple or Sony headsets, but this one fits extremely well. People now tap me to draw my attention, it's that good. The build looks fragile but is actually very sturdy.I got this product at a lightning deal during #FreedomSale and the product arrived on time, so no complaints with Amazon's delivery. However, the 3.5 mm connector that is provided with the box is a defective one. Not sure if Amazon or Sennheiser will replace that as it's been more than a month now and I never registered a grievance on the same.

7517,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I bought this for my mi phone. Never used such quality products, my brother recommended me this product. Happy with the purchase. Writing my review after almost 2-3 months or more ... Using it since long and no problems yet... Great buying

Bette to go for one more model in senheiser

7521,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Disgraceful, my family is buying the seinheiser’s earplugs since last 5years, it always been a more than satifaction experience with the product, but this is the degradation of its product (275s)..Never expected that seinheiser will compromise its quality.. BOAT earphone option might have been a better one..  :/
",1
7522,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The headphones are simply amazing considering the price of the product.Pros: The highs/ mids/ lows are all very clear. Each instrument and music effect sounds pretty amazing. Bass is very impressive. In my OnePlus One device i dont even need to use Audio FX to boost any of the original sounds in a song. Havent tried taking calls yet but m sure it will be good. Noice reduction is pretty amazing even on low volumes.Cons:To get perfect sound effects you need to raise the volume upto 30 %. The build quality seems to be flimsy, but am sure the 2 years warranty will take care of that. Could have also added volume controls with mic and remote button for taking calls.

I have used Sennheiser Earphone before and I Do like them the bass loving person will be Disappointed.. but if you want the balance of treble and bass this is the earphone.. the Isolation is Great..

I have replaced this product under warranty 4 times in last 2 years. Now as warranty is over the 4 th replacement also not working now. As you can see in pictures i have submitted wires from the tip of the pin start getting damaged within span of 1 or 2 months. I would request sennheiser to work on thier product build quality as they r offerings great sound and warranty service

7533,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best earphone for hearing music but not that good for playing movies.  Noise cancellation is good.I think price of product is hyped it should be between 900 to 1000rs.New update on reviewI had bought the earphone on 25th June 2017 and after 9 months of using it sound quality has dropped very low. Can barely hear in full volume. Going to courier it in service center. What a Drag!!!

7537,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Senheiser headsets and headphones are best as I have three of them.But shockingly this headset is provided with L connector because of that I really bought this because I already have senheiser 180street headphone.Shockingly L connector is not working seller is not responding to my question.If I don't get response in 4 days I will return and will buy mic separately and attach with my senheiser headphone.

7541,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The best Headset in low range for pure music listening.  I earlier had a Sony regular headset which was complete in itself.  The Beats and Bass of that one were better than any headset I have encountered.But after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.  The Overall bass is good but it isn't made for Bass based music. So if you want Bass go with Sony or Jbl but if you want beats,  obviously this is the One.I am writing this review after 6 months of purchase and have not encountered a single problem with the product.
",5
7542,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not worthable at that price. Try Sennheiser MX170, even MX170 also delivers same quality only thing is it doesn't come with mic for calling purpose. Other than this both MX170 and CX275 are same this is what i experienced. If the I received a defective, my review would be not correct.

7544,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am using these earphones for more than a year now. I can say they have the best sound quality and noise cancelling power.

7561,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's a very good product. Sennheiser always delivers a superior studio quality sound, nevertheless the headphone is noise-free or not. This product is a complete noise-free one, no noise from even besides you can interfere between your music moments. The quality of the sound is, as I've said, studio-quality. You can feel the sound waves grooving inside your head, if the music you're listening to is intended to be felt so, I mean, that is possible with this product. And the carrying pouch is nice, by the way.The only con, you can't hear what your friend is telling you sitting beside you.

7562,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best in its pricing categories! The sound cancellation is so good, can't hear a single thing from the environment when the music is on. The microphone is so sensitive that it catches unwanted sounds from the environment while on call. But, that's okay. Overall a good purchase!

7563,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser has been a reliable brand ever since I started listening to music. For anyone looking for a good earpiece with a mic, this masterpiece is bang on.Bass lovers may not like it as much, but if you're looking for details and practicality, CX 275S is what you would love at this price point.No sound distortion even at peak levels.Love this piece of engineering. <3

7578,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First of all... Talking about the sound quality...the highs and lows are amazing ....the mids are totally epic... The base is loud .....

7591,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"My first review... Awesome product... Crystal clear sound.. Optimum bass and treble.. 4.5 stars because wire is not that stylish, considering the price... And one thing.. If you want to buy.. Daily check the price for atleast a week.. I bought it for 1600 and within 3 days.. Price fell by 250.

7592,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Seriously if you connected that in a good smartphone like OnePlus then it's sound will be amazing, ga_d far, but if you have budget smartphone then go for it bcz you can't differentiate between this and any other 500-600  RS earphones in budget smartphone

7593,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Headphones are not bass heavy. A little too low for my liking. They seem good for vocals and watching videos. Not noise canceling but filters most sounds on the go. Details are good compared to similar priced earphones. Build quality is exceptional.
",5
7594,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Serves the purpose. Wanted something which is an all rounder and the CX275 s fits the bill perfectly. Call clarity is good and the mic does its job well. For prolonged usage, i suggest changing the in ear buds to the smaller one (different sized buds come along with this model) as the ones from factory were slightly bigger than required for me.

7595,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am using this earphone from past 2 years, still it works properly with awesome sound and great bass. I use this earphone mainly for gaming. I can also recognise the sorounding sounds in the game.

7596,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Value for money. Excellent Headphone ever. I am regular user of Sony. But Sennheiser CX 275 S In -Ear Universal Mobile Headphone With Mic (Black) is excellent. Clear beat of music. Every beat is awesome. Sennheiser better than Sony. Go for it.

7597,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Worst headphone ever, used it for 4 months and it broke, voice quality loud but not clear. No customer support from the manufacturer (wrong no:s & email id provided, u can never reach them) or Amazon (cannot do anything, hopeless). DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!

7606,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is not as good a feeling of other stuff sennheiser makes. It's very thin in feel and the quality of sound is not satisfactory for me as I tried Bose, jbl, and soundpeaks. I recommend other earphones (not the head phones).

7607,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound is clear and better than any mobile headphones. Only thing I miss in this product is sound control. You have to do this with mobile or tab manually. It only have call pick and drop option. Best feature is sound quality is superb and awesome.
",5
7608,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nice audio clearity balance sound but bass is bit low. Good durability not great and wire is long enough. Bass is even lower than CX 180 so if you are a bass lover buy CX 180 at lower price (rs 800) . Guys I'm not saying that cx 180 is better than this CX 275 has crystal clear sound quality.Mic 8/10Treble 9/10Base 7/10Noise isolation 7/10Overall I'll give 4 star there is no reason to give 5 star

7609,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"absolutely love this pair of ear buds. i needed something for my casual listening purpose while travelling, being on a budget these provided a great solution to that. at 1425 i couldn't have asked for a better deal. the best part is they are balanced, unlike most headphones on the market today that are just infused with meaningless bass. Don't get me wrong, these deliver amazing bass as well, but it's all controlled and the way it's supposed to be. amazing sound spectrum and clarity. anything for casual listening and beyond, go for it!

7611,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Decent earphones. Worth the price.1. Call cut button works just fine2. The same button, double tap to move to next track while listening to songs.3. Triple tap to move back to the previous track doesn't work. This worked with my Sony stock earphones.4. Sound quality is good.Although these features don't work when u use the extension that comes along with this. I'm not sure why the extension is required.If you are looking for a decent set of earphones this one is the right one for you. If u are an ardent listener and a music fanatic there may be other better options out there for you.

7612,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Well, I have used a lot many earphones over the years starting from Philips, Sony to Skullcandy etc etc of multiple ranges, be it below 500 or above 1500. But this particular product from Sennheiser has just upped my listening to music experience by miles. Simply one of the best of this range, and as an overall product also beats Sony and Skullcandy at its range. The music, the beats, the overall everything associated with a particular song feels even more vibrant now. I would suggest everyone and anyone looking forward to a decent earphone....go for this one. Absolutely worth it.
",5
7613,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound quality is not excellent but good i would say, i opted it because of it's mic. I think its sound quality equals to the samsung's original note 2 headphones. Not good for bass lovers, i am not bass lover so i am OK with it. Build quality is not that great as compare it to its price tag, very fragile item. I guess cx180 might suffice my requirement which is Rs.500 cheap than this.
",3
7614,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Built quality is pretty poor... But sound quality is best in this range... Not for bass lovers... It has v shape sound signature so it will have pure sound... I used it for 2 years... & Again after a long search for a upgrade I cannot find the better earphone so bought these...

7615,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"upgraded from CX213 and I'm loving it. Grea sound quality even at high volume and the inbuilt mic is icing on the cake. If you want to upgrade from CX213, go for it.

7616,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Let me be very honest, I ordered the product on Saturday night around 8:15 PM or so and received next day by 2:30 PM. The earphones are mind-blowingly amazing, far better than many headsets available at 2k-4k. Sennheiser did an amazing job with each and every bit of the headsets. The ear cushions are very soft therefore you can wear those for many hours, coming to the sound quality the bass output is top notch. I recommend without giving a second thought go and buy it now!!!
",5
7617,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If you're a Bass freak like me then you'll definitely love this. I'm using it with my oneplus one and definitely having a great time listening to GnR, Metallica, AC-DC, John Mayor, Keith Urban, Fossils, The Missing Link, Fakira etc. (not a Bollywood fan at all). Noise cancellation is very good. Anyways, the build is fragile though. It looks awesome. The leather pouch comes along is a life  saver. It takes calls and does it efficiently. Much better than many expensive butt caps available in the market today. Recommended to everyone. Thank me later.

7618,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"*Advantages:--Better sound quality-Ear fit design-Stylish*Disadvantages:--Feels like cheap quality wire (but it actually is good)-The mic was loose and was not fit inside the socket.-Mic quality is not very good.

7622,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is just brilliant, you can't ask for more crisp and clear sound in earphones under ₹2-3k, you can use them for a long time but the wire is somewhat fragile as it seems thought touchwood anything bad hasn't happened with my earphones so far

Xb55 ap have good bass and music quality is very good upto 80 percent of volume. Sony is better than jbl and cx275s. Driver size really matters but it is bulky and starts hurting if used for too long

7629,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Love the clarity of the Headset. If equalizers are adjusted it will give a dynamic sound and will not miss the crystal sound of the set.It blocks the out side sounds and use carefully while driving (especially riding a bike).Value for money and timely delivery from Amazon.

7646,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The Sennheiser CX 275 S has a straightforward design. The rubber buds are soft and comfy to wear. It has noise cancellation feature which is pretty good and a minimal design. It has a good bass and treble range. Overall sound clarity is above average and it is tailored for a bass heavy experience. If you require a fair clarity and awesome bass featured headpiece, definitely go for it.

7647,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Really good earbuds. What i like more about these is the directional separation of different sounds which is really good for immersion. And bass is okay too.. And these get really loud. At the maximum sound there is apparent distortion but trust me you aren't going to get volume that high since is really loud..

7648,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have used a lot of ear pods beats, Sony , Jbl etcBut this is the best I personally feel coz if someone a bass lover and clarity this one's the ultimate.

7649,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The headset Quality is good. Amazon delivery is also good. Rating wise 3star for headset and +1 star for fast delivery.

7670,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Purchased from cloud tail.(authorised seller for sennheiser in amazon).Very Very fast delivery.One of the best ear phones with mic. if microphone is not required then should definitely consider other options such as  CX 180 produces the same sound quality with some less Bass and sony mdr-xb30EX with heavy Bass.Pros  Very good sound quality.  Micro phone  Bass is very good (Thumps after 10 - 15 hr usage)  2 years warranty (no brand dare to give it.)  Leather Case.Cons  Build quality is low no tangle free cable.

7673,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I received the earphones within a day thanks to amazing Amazon delivery. I have used the headphones for 2-3 days and I am very impressed by its sound. Sennheiser never disappoints when it comes to sound, I have another model MX-170 and I have been using it for last 5 years and it still gives that good sound as ever. This has got a more than average bass to it, and the sound clarity and all sounds which are overpowered by bass can be heard. Mic also a big advantage, and its fits into the ear perfectly , no chance of falling out. There are multiple options depending upon ear size. The only bad thing is that it gets tangled very easily, and becomes a hassle to untangle.

7678,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Completely loving this guys!!!. The balance between base and sound clarity is just awesome . U can listen vocals as well as suits for bass heads . Sennheiser never disappoints ✌️✌️. I have tried both sound magic and Sony MDR xb50 ap but overall Sennheiser is the best .

7679,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The earphones are great they have a good sound quality. But the connector that comes with it was not functional... when i use the earphones with the connector, the sound disrupts.

7680,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best earphones under this budget .Good build quality .Powerful bass.Comes with a leather pouch to carry it in .

7681,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The headset is awesome and when it's worn, you are isolated from the world.Only limitation is that the wires are not having any protection but I have been using it about a month rough it's able to withstand.The 3.5 mm jack seems to be wearing out the gold plating earlier than expected, I have to adjust the plug to get sound in both ear pieces other one works for all the time unadjusted.

7682,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Product is really good. Sound is great and best in this range but build quality is not so great very thin wires(I fear that it may easily twisted and breakable), but good bag is included to carry it for you so no PROBLEM.

7683,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best product at this price. I was initially reluctant as many people has posted poor bass to be one of the drawbacks. Thankfully I found the bass perfect for music.

7684,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser is the best.. previously I have used a CX180 that was good but a little low on bass n without microfone.. But this CX275 fulfilled all d criteria for d best earphone in dis range.. better build quality.. decent sound quality n bass n awesome clarity.. Loved it♥️
",5
7685,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have recently purchased these earphones after doing lots of research. And after using it for 1 week I can only say that they sound fine, not great. And if you talk to someone via mic, then you need to hold the mic close to your mouth which is not suitable for long calls.

7686,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good quality but 1 side stops working after sometime. 2 year warranty with replacement is good.

7687,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is good enough and ears doesnt pain after prolonged use .Previously i used Skullcandy smoking buds which used to create pain after two hours of use. Although the noise cancellation for Smoking buds was better then this one. Comes with an awesome small carrying pouch .

7688,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Beautiful product which fulfills your soul and body with music, detaching you completely from any damn distraction and disturbances, either in train, in railway station, anywhere.

7689,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Simply a value for money.Sound quality is excellent in this price range. Balanced sound... Doesn't feel like lowering of vocal during bass... Simply awesome... A must buy in 1700 price. Recommended for anyone who wants balnced sound nd bass is not that high as in sony in-ear earphones but it is a earphone for all the daily users. Wire quality looks a little bit fragile nd weak bt its not. Noise cancelling is awesome.. Blocks almost all sound from outside.

7690,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This bass driven earphone from Sennheiser may not be for everyone. But if you are looking for a lightweight earphone which has remote and mic as well as sounds decent, this is the one to buy

7691,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Hands down to this brand. This is one hell of a earphones I'll ever own. Starting from the package to the material quality to the sound quality nothing could have been more perfect than this. Every penny was worth it! Thankyou so much Sennheiser for producing such quality products and setting a benchmark!
",5
7692,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"it's really good. But jbl t150 a gives almost same quality at considerably lower price (this one is slightly better though). So if u are looking for value for money go for jbl t150a (available at 899 when I ordered this ) or else this is fabulous.. Specially the ear buds are super comfortable (much more comfortable than jbl ones). The wire is a little thin but sturdy. The material looks a bit sticky. Better keep it carefully if you don't plan  use  it for a long time. (one of my older Nokia headset suffered from that. Got tangled and rubber melted and ultimately unusable).But in short if you are looking for a good earphone with mic in mid range budget this is a solid option.

7693,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Microphone does not works. Can hear callers voice but peer caller does not hear our voice. So it's only for music listening

7697,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I'm writing this review after 3 months of purchase.Sound quality is awesome. Ear buds hold the position very well. Length of the cable is very convenient. The pouch and the box look trendy and the extra pairs of ear buds provide extra fitting options. But one less star for the cable which needs to be handled with utmost care to avoid tear.

7698,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser CX275s is really awesome. Although at first look you might see that wires are very thin but they are sturdy. Got this for only 1299 INR.

7702,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Expected more for this price. But there is no bass effect, sound is crispy and loud. That's it.Product is genuine, but didn't provide bass effect. I have recently used Philips 600 rupees headset which is having more bass than this.But noise cancellation is top class. When listening can't even hear other people talk!!

7703,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It was a really worth Headset which im using for my One plus One phone. Its worth every penny which you pay, sound clarity is really very good. Noise cancellation is good but not the 100% noise cancellation. When im in skype call, i do hear every other noise as well apart from the person voice!!! But really good product. Im loving it.. Hearing the Music in this head phone is really a very good experience. And more over 2 years warranty i bet no one would provide for this cost.And if anything ever happens to your ear phone there will be replacement with the entire new one from the company itself(as 2 years Warranty period), which till now i haven't seen from any other company would do.
",5
7704,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Everything mentioned in the product description is perfectly true -- what do you want more? One thing I should mention is wire is thin with a Capital T, but it has two year of warranty so you don't need to worry thinking that ""I might break the wire"" and something like that.....
",4
7705,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"In present if consumer buying high cost product then they need the durability and flexible quality in all condition. The said earphones wires quality is bad, very thin & very sensitive... Despite the good quality sound we cannot use it freely.

7706,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The audio is pretty good. Bass is average. But the built quality is really bad. After 6 months the insulation is worn out. I'm not a hard core user. The product is just bad.

7707,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bass lovers would love this. It has a good sound quality or I say best at its range. You cannot compare this with bose or beats, but this is far better than JBL, Sony, apple earphones (compared to this price band)
",4
7708,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If anyone want clarity and balanced sound output go for it. Sennheiser signature sound. Love it. Mic quality is average. Material is OK type, wires do tangle a lot. If u just want bass, search for other earphones.

7709,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good Bass and awesome noise cancellation. But the wires not tangle-free.Sound clarity is very good. Produces high quality sound even at the high volumes.Initially I thought Senheiser will not produce good bass. But these earphones are out of the ordinary.It has a perfect balance between bass and the chores. Bass is not killing other sounds.The mic also works well with my OnePlus One.... Go for it.Value for money product!!!!!

7721,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Comfortable in ear. Proper noise cancellation. Good bass at this price point. There is little bit of doubt about wire as it's thin. But being Sennheiser  brand that thing must have been considered. Over all I am satisfied. Boat might be a good option than this one.

7726,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best at this price range. I bought it for 1350(including offers). At medium and low volumes the sound is too good. But when the volume is at high, the music is little odd. On the whole, you can go for it at this range.

7727,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If u r a person who takes care of gadgets very well, then this suits you.. good sound quality is the pro.. but it’s wire is very thin, maybe the smallest in dia I’ve ever seen.. u have to take extra care while handling.. also it uses cheap plastic,appears cheap product..

7733,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Original Product. Registered it on the Sennheiser website for 2 years of warranty service. Deep bass as required. The only this is the wire is too thin and have to take special care not to tangle/ pull or push by mistake.

7734,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"When i was looking for an ear phone with call facility, every one was suggesting samsung and other brands. At max they suggested to go for sony.I had an experience of Sennheiser CX 180 and they were far better for listening training video than Creative ep 630.I thought to give it a try and luckily i was successful. These ear phones are made to listen voice calls and perfect in listening music as well.Guess what after me, two of my friends also bought the same ear phone for them.Truly worthy for their features and their price, oops i forgot  - you get two years warranty replacement

7735,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Built quality is top notch. Sound quality is also excellent. Just go for it you wont be wrong for  sure.

7738,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Most worthy in ear head phones. I am too glad to have them. Although, i was not happy with the delivery boy, as I ordered the headphones at my office address expecting it to be delivered on Weekdays, but it reached on Sunday and delivery boy didn't agree to delivery it at my house lying in a radius of 500m. Taking about headphones - the sound quality is best. Even  while driving on a busy road, a volume level of 40 is enough to give crystal clear sound with bass. For some, the price seems out of budget but trust me - tje quality is much more than expectations.

7739,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Its sound clarity, bass and Mic are awesome. Noise cancellation is perfect.

7743,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This German maker's budget headset delivers Average quality, for the money sound, expect nothing else. Before buying this i was using Samsung Headset that came with the Note 2. Surprisingly i was not able to differentiate between them. Sound quality was same in both. So only if your bundled headset came with your high end smartphone is broken and not working any more go for this. These would be a perfect replacement. Anything more than that you would be disappointed.

Noise cancellation is excellent ( Don't USE while driving/riding the bike).4. Remote button is really good , its feature.  4.1-  You can pick the call.  4.2-  You can change the song by double press, and pause the song by single press.Cons:1. Built quality is OK (Looks like Plastic type).2. Thin cable.3. Bass is not up to the mark.4. Mic doesn't cancel the external noise (Like Mobile phone's built-in Mic). Its good to use in closed area / Traffic-less place.

The design is intuitive. wire may look fragile but believe me they are sturdy.  I hope it lasts long.  5 star for the Product but i have given 4 because of the extended time for delivery.  i paid extra 50 rupees for fast delivery but they took one day extra.

7763,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This earphones doesn't keep the expectations.. The cx 180 has the best sound but this seems like a normal sound.. It doesn't have that rich clear sound like cx 180.. It's like they have reduced the quality of the sound only coz they have provided the mic. But overall it's decent.

7764,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great sound though .Expected more from this.The whole size is little bigger for my ears.But it fitted well.I bought it for my asus zenfone 5 .zen fone earphones are smaller than this.But it gives you good sound.Mic works perfectly well.If you are expecting bass don't go for this

7776,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The ear phones are really good , sounds is not that clear , bass is little high. In this price and the warranty this is really a good product

7777,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sennheiser CX275 s ear phones are not that much responsive. I have used Creative EP 630, it sounds better than these. Even I've used Sony MDR-EX220 but they are also not clear;  base is good but crispness absent. I will suggest creative.I must say dont' go for this expensive earphone, even the the company name-Sennheiser is not giving justice to quality of sound. Even half price other brand earphones are much better than this.One good suggestion, before purchasing any earphone, first use it.Ask some one who is using it to give you for trying.(don't feel hesitant, its your question of satisfaction, better be known before than crying afterward )Try it and when you are satisfied with the sound  then only purchase it.

7781,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good speakers and powerful mic...that's the - as well.. If you have the headset ON and taking calls in a relatively noisy environment, the person in the other side of the call might hear the sound in manyfold... Music quality is good.. Good fit in ears.. Got a pouch to keep the earphones.. Better sound.. 2 years warranty...

7782,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These earphones are just good not excellent.Not a excellent quality of sound at this price.Price around Rs1100/- will be apt for this earphone, not a worthy once at 1700.bass,clarity was not awesome but good.

7783,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is really good.I like the bass effect and don't like the quality of wire,feels like so light and get damage soon.The brand shows its quality in the music.I used Philips,skull candy and JBL,didn't get the Effect which Sennheiser gave.

7784,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The product came very good packaged, the sound quality is best, many earphones below 1k have issue one side going off. For some this maybe expensive but believe me it have the best sound quality and having two year warranty is peace of mind.

7786,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"One of. The best in this price range and most important original from AmazonIn built pin is for iPhone,,ipad n blackberryIt has an adapter pin for Samsung, moto etcInitially I didn't knew so used randomly n was not satisfied with sound qualityBut once I realized the correct pin, I could use it on all phones in my family with superb sound quality performanceI also use it to dictate letters on my iPad using SiriLooks fragile but tough enough for daily useSo overall satisfactory price performance 4*

7787,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I'm really satisfied with this headphone. super clarity, decent bass., and excellent noise isolation.. n really soft ear buds.. very comfortable to wear.. I bought it for Hyderabad Kerala bus journey and I'm happy with my choice.. long time listening not hurting my ears.. and the best thing is it comes with a pouch that easily fits in shirt's pocket.. so no more tangled mess.. all in all the best headphone for mobile with a mic.. oh forgot to mention.. really good volume.. no need to crank up to maximum. less than half volume is enough. thanks to perfect noice isolation..
",5
7788,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Worth to buy for this decent price. You should however not dream of using microphone too much for it would not work on all devices at first and not last longer in any case on any other devices at other hand. Sound quality is pleasing indeed.

7789,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I was really looking for this kind of earphone as, it's sound is really higher then my expectations even while travelling in metro i can watch movies with good sound quality which is not possible from any other.....

7790,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"One of the best earphone you can get under 3k. Crystal clear sound, perfect bass and balanced every bit. Design is awesome m Nice Fit. Overall best earphone I purchased ever.

7791,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is amazing. I used many brands earphones some of them were costly, but in this price range this one is best. Material quality is good.
",5
7792,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Although Sennheiser is known for its quality sound and I have used their earphones before, I was disappointed with the sound quality with these.  The bass is very poor. I have tried them across iPhone and Android phones across various tracks.  Will not recommend them. Have initiated a return.
",2
7793,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very good earpiece. Well i have used many but this one has higher volume with respect to others and quality is also good.  The earpiece cover or pouch that comes with it is really helpful, this prevents it from tangling to itself.
",5
7794,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Its good. Not Awesome. I own CX180 already and I was happy with the sound quality of it.I bought this just because it is having mic support with smartphones.Pros: Good Sound Quality as always from Senheiser, Mic recording is beautiful, extension given and the pouch is given good enough to carry in your bag/purse.Cons:Not a tangle free wire, While placing the earphone in the ear we need to hold it at the tip. there is no kind of covering layer given at the joint of ear bud and wire connecting it so that we can hold it while placing it. (CX180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) , I would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike. A BIG NO NO. for those who are purchasing this for daily bike travel. as this tends to tangle alot and the fear is that without the holder i mentioned above it might cut it from the tip.
",4
7795,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nice clarity,  loud sound,  good sounf effect.  However i feel bass is not so good especially on iphones.  Also,  if i keep mic near to my mouth other person can here me breathing on call n if i keep normal they can't here.  Overall net net its a good buy.

7796,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"But recieve defective ... Mic side earphone little bit slow not balanced sound.. have to claim warranty

7797,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"awesome... recently i had cx180 which is ok..but cx275 is perfect. you can get awesome,  loud sound from this now. you can listen every beat. if you are music lover i will suggest you cx275 over cx180. cx275 is more better.

7798,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Writing review after using this product for more than one year... Really value to money product. Brand quality you know trustable.
",5
7799,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I like the bass and clarity when comes to music and videos, because of brand the price is worthy for sound but i expect more build quality of wire.When comes to calls its really bad because of in-ear.

7801,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"No if and buts I will conclude that this is best earphone in terms of sound quality HIGHS ARE DAMN CRISP MIDS AND LOWS ARE BETTER THAN DESCENT ONE THING THAT BUGS ME IS THAT IT'S BUILD QUALITY IS NOT UPTO THE LEVEL (THESE EARPHONES ARE FOR THOSE WHO PREFER MORE CRISPS AND RICH SOUND)

7802,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great Bass ! awesome earphone for that price. Only issue is there is no hard plastic cover or roller to roll up the wires. But never the less, amazing product.
",5
7803,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I ordered these for my iPhone 4 after a lot of research and reading thru all the reviews. Original apple earphones set you back by 2.2 grand and I being a regular( read=over user) of the earphones, all of them invariably last for a maximum of 1 year. 2 grand every year is not a nice thing. I bought these and must say I love it. Occasionally there are some minor issues with the volume when it increases all of a sudden marginally, nevertheless still love it. There is mic also which makes taking calls easier, however no volume buttons . You have to use the phone to reduce/increase the volume. All in all a great pair of earphones for 1.5 K and worth every penny. Waits to be seen how long it lasts

7804,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Wooow ...the sound quality is nice.  I am very interested with this item

7807,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Though the sound quality is very good and loud but I'm worried for the wire. Seriously it's too thin and also it's not a flat type. So, sometimes when it tangles it becomes very difficult to sort out.Otherwise I like it,rather love it.....for its excellent noise cancellation.
",4
7808,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's good, thought would be better than cx180, but didn't found any much difference.Instead spending extra bucks on this will suggest to go for cx180, if you are sennheiser freak!

7809,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The product worked for about 2.5 years. One side stopped working. The mic quality is good 👍. Sound quality is also good. Bass is not very good.

7810,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Quality has gone down. I used to own the same product which I bought from Flipkart over 3 years back. It had better sound and also lasted longer. It's a little over 6 months and the plastic is coming off from the headphones.

7817,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The thing it got is clear sound, gud noise cancellation and mic also cord quality is great. But, it was not well in all aspect for the price it was paid for . As it was only gud for voice calls.

7818,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The Sennheiser CX 275s is an earphone pair geared towards the bass lover on a modest budget. At Rs. 1690, it's neither cheap nor over-priced, and offers solid, distortion-free audio performance. The boosted lows will scare away purists, and even bass fiends might find the highs, which are boosted and tweaked in peculiar spots, occasionally tinny or harsh. An inline remote control and microphone add value to the CX 275s, but the remote lacks volume controls, which is a bit of a bummer. Overall, the CX 275s is a powerful pair with a lot to love,Pros - Powerful, distortion-free audio performance with deep, boosted lows. Inline remote control and microphone for mobile devices. Comfortable, secure, lightweight fit.Cons - Inline remote has no volume controls.

7825,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"When you first use it you can clearly note the sound clarity. Bass is not too much overriding, punchy and neat. Mids and vocals are neatly audible. Cable is durable and I love the pouch provided to carry the earphone.Definitely recommended

7829,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"didn't liked them much as it has lots of treble, earlier i had mx270 it too had treble and less bass, but this one kills bass, no bass at all. I guess that goes for all Sennheiser headphones. though kept it as voice is clear so good for watching movies, but not ideal for songs.

7833,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Thank you amazon for quick deoivery. I researched a lot before buying this earphone usually I buy 3-4 headsets every year. I have used  sony and sound magic es10 recently but this is cx275 is better then both. I wish they could have controlled the treble and lows more. Sometimes it feels very loud though I was able to control that by help of equalizer. I am using this with my one plus one and its working good. Since I have started using it recently I can't comment on the durability but wire is very thin. Pouch is ordinary and additional ear adapter sets are as u get with any other product. So overall its a good buy in this budget range.

7834,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Waste product...really disappointed with the product and service. Not a good clarity and Quality. If you buy for MOTOG hendset you r facing jack problem and u will damage your handset jack slot also.:(

7836,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is good, but material durability is zero, I mean 0. Even gently keeping in pocket made it tangled and wire came out. The wire is not at all durable. At this price expects a durable product along with sound.

Packaging was good and as well usual amazon rockszz.

7842,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bass could be even better, overall sound quality is good.  I felt its cost should not be more than 1200, brought it around 1700. Overall satisfying with this product.

7844,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Ordered this as birthday gift for my cousin. It arrived on time even when Bengaluru was in partial curfew due to strikes. 5 stars for that.Cousin is happy with the sound quality. Build quality could have been better.

7845,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I got these earphones and a brilliant price of 1300 bucks! It has stunning clarity for music and for calls. I loved the fact that there is an additional pouch to carry these earphones. Even other expensive brands wouldnt provide a pouch at this price point. I checked multiple websites and still got the best price on Amazon. At a sub 1500 price point, these are definitely a must buy! Excellent bass and treble balance. The add on connector sent with the earphones is a fantastic add on in case you are using older android phones where this connector is a must-have. Just buy this earphone without any second thoughts if it hits a 1300 or 1400 price point. Amazon as always, you rock in your delivery.

7846,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is a great product. At first I was skeptical, because I read some of the poor reviews but now that I've tested the product (great delivery time btw), I find it really balanced, in terms of bass, treble, voice clarity, loudness and noise cancellation. Also, I didn't find any discomfort with long duration usage. I just ordered another piece of the same earphones for my mom.All in all, a great purchase. Very satisfied.

7847,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have tried many headphones from sennheiser,but this one holds a special place in my heart coz of its perfect bass...bass is simply perfect..Unlike Sony,the accurate bass is not killing the crispiness and the clarity of the songs played in these..Awesome pair..definitely better than Sony xb30 in clarity and bass.

The bass is present and its there for how much u need, good thing is its(bass) is not overpowering. The mids and highs are balanced too.Verdict:- These earphones are a good even a great package for the price the sound quality is great design is great and the build quality too is nice.

Low & Mids are not so good, to enjoy  the music u have to keep the volume in  high else you wont feel the bass  3. Bass is medium

7863,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very bad experience with this product. Sound quality is extremely good but one ear plug has stopped working. I have purchased it in May'18 and not even 6 months passed one of the ear plug has stopped functioning. If you are looking for durability don't go for this product.
",3
7864,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"As usual Sennehiser gave the best audio. I was using Cx 180 earlier but due to no mic in that, I bought this one and it is obviously more crisp and clear in quality that 180. Though the product is priced more than 180 but it is worth it. Covering more frequency than 180 on both ends gives this product an extra value for the buck and also another great experience with Sennheiser.

But quality of wire some what thinkable because it is simple and light. May be damage if more pressure on it.5. Bass quality was awesome6.

7871,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Straight up gonna say; buy the Sony XB-55 extra bass (with or without mic) if you have the budget. These earphones are more fragile and the bass is better on the Sony earphones.

7934,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nice.product. very good sound clarity. The wires are a bit thin, which seems to be a negative. Go for it if you are looking for good quality sound and happy with normal wired headfones
",4
7935,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These have got to be one of the best headphones I've had in a very long time. It knocks the socks off its competition with the greatest of ease.Points to ponder -1) At this price point, you cannot get a better product, build is very sturdy2) The base on these things is incredible, treble and midrange kicks butt3) The noise reduction is very good4) Pair this with a Fiio headphone amp (Any one) and you might just go insane
",5
7936,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"One of the best earphones with mic below 2k. I wouldn't say the bass is great but it's decent enough. Audio quality depends upon the bitrate, so better download the songs in 320kbps to enjoy the audio quality of the earphones. Build quality is good.Though the wires get tangled quite often, I find it easy to untangle it compared to other wired earphones. You get an earphone pouch to carry around.

7937,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good earphones with high quality sound and bass. Got this for the accompanying mouthpiece. Had received a defective product earlier, but it was replaced after registering a complaint.
",5
7938,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Build quality could be better. Sounds is great, treble seems high if u ve been using other earphones around 1000 bucks but covers all frequencies and is crisp. The button can also be used to pay our pause the music. Ear pods are very comfortable and well designed, the best I have used till date. At first I had doubts but after using for few months, build quality only looks delicate but its strong and sound is just awesome, no competition in this price range

7939,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Please give at least up-to 30 days to return the products. I did not like it after 25 days as it started behaving weird, without any physical intervention. I am not at all satisfied and i want to return the product and buy something else. Not at all fair!

7940,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"3rd time ordering this product.  Mic with headset the only available high quality nose isolated headset is this cx 275s and available for 2k It's far better when composted with 300 stores which has no mix as well to costly.

It comes with a nice black pouch for storing your earphones when not in use.If you listen to music and watch movies on your smartphone or laptop, then this product is a good buy.Word of caution: Please do not misuse the earphones by pulling hard on the wires while removing it from the pouch or from your ears.

7963,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I've been using this headset for quite a few days now and I can say I'm in love with it.I have used skullcandy and sony earplugs before but I recommend this over the others(if your budget is around 1500). The sound quality is at its best. Treble is awesome and a good thumping bass. If you want earplugs with great bass then I'd recommend Sony MDR.But the overall quality of the sound is best in cx 275s. If you want to buy great earplugs with mic and your budget is around 1500 then this is the best headset available and should buy it with eyes closed.

Also sometimes bass feels overpowered but that can be controlled by Equalizer. 4.5 stars to this because extra L-cable provided with the product doesn't work in some instances. E.g while connecting it with pc/laptop.Rest is just amazing. Bass feels like actual bass and doesn't tear up the sound.

7993,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I hope i got the duplicate product. Heard so many good reviews and bought it. After 3-4 days of use, i did not find any thing special. It was working as a normal earphone with normal voice. So returned.

7994,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great earphones, nice and clear sound. I am not an audiophile and neither do I have much knowledge of the same, so can't really give much input on that.The design is really good and the built quality is great too. There is no ""R"" or ""L"" on the earphone pieces but rather a small bump on the Left earpiece to recognize the, or the inline-min can be used instead.Comes with a nice soft pouch.I'd recommend to to anyone looking for a decent inexpensive in-ears

7996,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The earphone is alright. I recommend everyone to buy Sennheiser cx-180 street rather than this product since it has a better quality sound,bass and value for money (around ₹800) . But it does not have a mic.Or else consider Sony earphones rather than this.

7997,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Headphones produce deep bass as compared to other headphones within range. Build quality of headphones is really good. They provide travelling pouch with headphone. I am using it since 4 months. I am fully satisfied with it.

7998,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's quite the delicate pair so you'll have to be super careful with it. You can't just keep taking and throwing it around. The wire is thin, feels like it'll wear out any moment so you have to handle with care.

8047,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I had sennheiser MX180 before and became a fan of sennheiser from there.  Bought this one for my oneplus one as it has universal compatibility of mic. This piece of awesomeness pairs so well with the oneplus one that the sound output is the best ever I have heard from a mobile device. At this price it's an awesome asset to have. Definitely go for it!!!

8048,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sounds good and best part is play pause and change the songs while driving.Not good quality with bass but overall its a good product in this price.

8050,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very clear, isolating, high quality sound, fitted nicely in ears (although they've given 3 more sizes of ear buds). Long enough cable. Doesn't entangle. The color did not fade up after 10 months of use.

8051,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Working just perfect,one of the best budget earphones I recommend this over every earphone which is present in the market right now. Don’t think so much just go for it
",5
8052,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Fantastic headphones with great details in music. You'll really feel the difference with other headphones. I reduced one rating because the wire is bit thin, Less Bass and mic is not that great.Voice - 10/10Bass - 7/10Treble - 10/10

8053,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If ur looking for all small details in sound with required bass then just go for itbecause it provides u balanced sound.

8054,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good quality and durability of products at buying price. Totally worth it
",4
8055,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is my 5th Sennheiser product and I am always happy with the brand. Particular to this, I got what I paid for. It is true value for money.
",5
8056,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"1 it is difficult to connect with the phone , do no why it takes such time any setting to connect with phone and mic is a big issue ,the other caller on phone is not able hear what we are speaking and not clear..
",2
8057,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Comes with ear buds of 3 sizes. Sound quality is yummy and I would highly recommend it. Buying another one for a gift to a friend. Just go for it if you want good music with mic and a single button which helps in my case for going to the next track/previous track and pausing.Would have given it a 6 if it had volume controls. None the less - it's amazing.
",5
8058,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is good from all perspective except it is not durable as expected.  Since I had the same previous head phone but after ~2 years, sound stopped coming from one side.
",5
8059,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is just ok. I think cx213 is way good by this cx275s. If you have a flexi budget, i would recommend you to buy cx3.0 than this,or just go for cx213.Build quality is below par. Can't listen on full keys as it reverbs a lot.
",3
8060,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound quality is great, no distortion at all. A little noise comes while driving a two wheeler even with a helmet on. The bass is not too great compared too lower range earphones but although a good product.
",4
8061,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The quality of the product is really good. I really liked the noise cancellation which I was not expecting even at this price range.
",4
8062,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound is great and it's noise cancellation is good. I cannot hear a damn thing from background when I'm listening to my MusicCould have given volume controls on the control pads. And I do not like the Hands Free calling, when I talk on the mic I also need to listen to my self to conversate properly which I cannot do because the In-ear plugs just stick in your ears and stop any sound entering into your ears.All in all this in-ear headphones make a great headset for listening to music but not so great for hands free calling.
",3
8063,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Lightweight, comfortable and sounds good. But wires are too thin and fragile. May not last long if roughly used.
",4
8064,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I bought this in Aug 2017. Great sound while it worked. Of late the left ear bud has stopped sounding. Have tweeted to sennheiser for a replacement.

",2
8066,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These are the greates ear phones I have ever had, I wanted to keep my review short and sweet.Starting with the physical appearance, the wire is thin and they even are not too fragile. The grooves on both the pods are perfect and made well to adjust into the ear. They have a great sense of music, highly recommended for music freaks.Caution: You can't even hear 0.001% of outside noise,
",5
8067,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not comfortable to wear, sound quality is just average and not a good product to buy.I used Sennheiser products earlier and this one just crap......
",2
8068,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is a duplicate product because if it is an original product the volume switch would not get faulty within 6 months or sparingly used earphone.
",2
8069,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I loved the product. The packaging was really good. I got extra item with the box. the bass is really good on this headphone. the mic works .

8070,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have been using these ear phones for 3 years now. They are highly durable, for sure. Sound quality is good. Not great. Overall for someone looking for decent earphones, these are a great buy.
",4
8071,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If you're looking for in-ear plug-in earphones with a microphone around Rs. 1500 then close your eyes and buy this one. High tech sound quality and clear Microphone. The earphones look very cool as well, specially along with the pouch that they provide free!Closest competitor would be the JBL T200A.Sennheiser wins in terms of looks, sound quality and durability.

8075,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good soundPowerful bassRoom in style...wire was not good...I feel the voice was good.,For general use it was best ...But regular use not good...
",5
8076,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Loved the sound clarity better than Skull Candy, phillips and Creative earphones I used. The noise cancellation needs a special mention. The cover provided in the pack also comes handy

8077,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Loud and clear,  it makes feel each and every beat of the song.Music goes to another level.
",5
8078,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Value for money. Works well. Sounds very well.

",5
8083,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Over all good earphones.Mic integration works well with my nexus 4. Bass is not extraordinary but at par considering its price. Sound is crisp and clear except a few instances when bass overshadows mid frequencies.
",4
8084,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good quality for voice calls and decent for music. Not heavy on the bass like Sony headphone. But surely worth the money and build quality is superb.

The build quality is good though it doesn't look that way. Moreover 2 year warranty. If you are looking for earphones in this price range, you have nothing better.
",5
8090,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound is very clear with optimum bass and very nice treble. you will feel as if you are listening to the high end home theater system.Normally people think higher the bass better the earphone, that should not be the case since treble is also equally important.The best thing about this earphone is it doesnt hurt your ear. It's a pleasure owning one.Amazon service is really excellent.

8092,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Noise isolation is good. Clarity of music is excellent; the best in this price range I guess. Bass: not bad, but if you love high bass levels, you'll hate this. Packaging and delivery- awesome as always.Returned the item because I used a friend's Sennheiser HD202 and thought that is better. I wanted to use it for my musical keyboard and ear canal earphones don't work that well for this cause.

8106,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Just loving the earphone. Previously using ZenEarphone (came as default earphone with Zenfone 5) which was also good but left part of the earphone stopped working recently. The sound quality of Sennheiser CX 275 S is much better than ZenEarphone in terms of bass. Happy with earphone.
",5
8107,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Outer Packaging was not upto to the mark and other than that Earphone build quality is good as it's wire is quite delicate so you need to handle it carefully. Sound quality is just awesome as expected.

8108,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good pair of headphones for this price range. Effective noise cancellation while playing music.

8113,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Its awesome Headset with very clear sound. it great response for very low frequency sound. Bass is good. it has universal microphone and call pick-up/cancel button that makes it suitable for all smart phones.

8120,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is the best headphone under ₹ 2000. Sennheiser gives a excellent product. The sound quality is awesome. Bass are excellent and treble is adjusted. And the most valuable information about this headphone is if you are hearing in full volume it won't disturb you ear. Great piece of headphone. I recommend it for all music lovers.

8121,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is really soothing. It's crystal clear. It's not bass heavy, so it's really comfortable to listen for a long period of time.

8122,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"i have been using this for 6 months and wire quality degraded like a local headset and 2 years warranty is of no use, lightly wear and tear will not be considered in warranty policy

8123,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is amazing.It's really good in build quality too.Just protect it from heavy sweat, as they can not bear the sweat at all. Specially not recommended to use in gym or running ir any other sports or cardio activity.Otherwise to listen music in these hps is a treat.
",5
8124,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Cx 180 is better in sound quality than cx275s.. Only advtg is it has mic..cx 180 is half of its price.. So better to go for cx180. Its just waste of money..
",3
8125,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bought these for around 1650Rs, too costly for the quality they offer. Go for something else than sennheiser, try JBl if you love base.

8126,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound is very good, though I am no pro with sounds. I liked it more than my Samsung and Sony headsets. I use it with my Asus Zenfone 2. It can change tracks and take/drop calls. The wires are very thin, but you are not expected to do a tug-off-war with them. I registered these on the official web page and they are genuine pieces with a two year warranty. Peace of mind!
",4
8127,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Loving the experience of this beast...pouch is very good. Just one caution, handle the earphone with care. use the bag always. deducted one star for the thin wires. Amazon delivery was damn good. got it one day before hand. No need to think twice about this one!!

8128,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best earphones available around ₹1500 but the wires are really thin could break if you are a rough user

8129,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very good quality earphone with amazing sound clarity.. Music lover with bass may not feel that exited but overall performance is very good.Deal between 1350 to 1450 worth
",4
8130,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It was awesome the music and no complaints regarding quality. But I found one thing very disturbing was when I connect it with my mobile or laptop there seems to be motor or some sound that runs in both earphones, when music is being played it couldn't be heard but when it is quiet and when it is connected to any device that motor sound comes. Its very disturbing. Not sure it's a thing in every earphone.
",3
8131,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Build quality is good. Although wires are very slim but using since two months now seems no problem with that. Sound quality is good not the best. But for this price it is not value for money..
",4
8132,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Ahh!! What a product! Excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. A little bit costly as compared to other ones but it's worth. Slightly disappointed from wire quality but overall awesome product.
",5
8133,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Noise cancellation is ok but not the best I've ever experienced. Sound quality is lit (for old folks sound quality is good. I mean, great.) And as far as working out is concerned, it's good.

8134,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Ons side is not working, after using it for 1 year.  Sound quality and bass is really good. I always preferred this.
",5
8135,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Best headset you can buy with in 2k,  guys really I am saying its amazing, noise isolation job is fantasti.  Bass is not overwhelming, sharp and crisp sound. I used my Z1 headsets iinitially, compared to that, this is far far far outstanding. Sony is not worst but when it comes under competition,  SENNHEISER wins. But u can feel chord is little Thin when compared to other, but performance is thundering.
",5
8136,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"When I ordered it I was like.. Its sennheiser and it'll be cool and sound would be cool. But when I used it for first time they turned out to be awesome. They fit into ears just perfectly, bass is truly great and the mic is really fantabulousIt truly reduces the outside noises, music is clear and you can hear those beats clearly which you would have missed other wiseThis headset might not be the best, but for the money you pay its as best as it can get

8137,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Noise cancelling 5/5Sound quality 5/5Bass 4/5Only problem i found is in build quality, you have to be extra careful while using, but the 2 year warranty covers it

8138,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Quality of cable is pathetic... Having issues listening to music... Want to return it..... Not worth the 1700 you spend..
",1
8139,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It has good sound quality but I kind of not like it bcz mic has stopped working within a month which is a very bad review. If u want to buy any earphone then go for any other than this brand because it is costly also.
",1
8140,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Overall the sound is excellent but if you like bass so these provide not that powerful bass but it is average in bass but other than that these are really good one to use and the crystal clear sound is just amazing
",3
8141,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is ok not great. I was expecting this product will be good compared to other but it is same. Instead purchasing this you can go for JBL or Sony earphone with in half range of this.
",3
8142,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Awesome product,Worth buying,Bass is dam good and sound quality is up to the mark,German engineering & design proved in this product,Only one little con Is cable is rubberized, required silicone rubber cable like Sony MDR XB series,In this price range (I bought around 1300) it's very good product.
",4
8143,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Trust me when I say that this is the best in the price range. Does not blow every other earphone in this price range out of the water but it's the small things which matter. Sturdy,  really  sturdy. Never hurts you ears with sharp beats like some other earphones.....  Small things but really important for the perfect experience for this price range.
",5
8144,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good earphone, great sound and best noise cancellation, pouch will be available but wire quality of earphone is average, it will damaged within 1.5 years
",4
8145,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Terrible. Not worth the price. Awful durability. Had a return option been there I would have definitely used it.
",2
8146,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sounds quality is is pretty good..A little problem is that wo can not use it for long durations.. not too much comfortable for long time use.. I can  feel the pain in ears after 3-4 hour of use
",4
8147,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"With mic earphones always lack bass but not this one. I use Audio Fx with my one plus one and these earphones rock the s*** out of my ears!Mic is also good and the in-call quality is great. You wont hear anyone complaining that you are not audible on the other side of call.Price should be a little less but hey, its German.Definitely go for this.
",5
8148,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The Names says it all... GERMAN....its shear class n perfection...Even with the volume set in half levels, the effect is ultimate...Ultimate background noise cancellation...With these on, Hell I just forget the fact that I'm travelling amidst the Crappy Madras traffic....The only draw back I felt is that u just cant be humming along with the song, its annoying...Else...Ol is well...
",5
8149,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I don't think these earphones not too suitable for gaming after I had experience with headphones. May be all of earphones not good for gaming. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

8152,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Awesome earphones.Great sound quality and the good thing is that the sound of the music doesnt go out of the ears even if it is on full volume.Worth the price.

8153,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I llike sennheiser earphone...... I have already used one.... And this is my second experience..... And i am using this before some month and for this as my expectation......
",5
8154,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Amazing sound quality. I own Bose and Skullcandy earbuds as well. Though nothing can beat Bose in terms of audio quality, it does come with a very high price tag attached to it! For listening to music while commuting to work I wanted something that would offer really good sound and would not be very expensive. These are probably one of the best among in-ear buds in the same price range.
",5
8155,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The wire length is quite useful and I like the button for picking up calls or pausing the videos. The wires are a bit thin but still look durable. I've used this product for approx 3 months have had no complaints yet.

For <2k, this is the best choice.

8168,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Beast and worth penny.. dont have to think twice.. but use it with external audio players preferably poweramp available in play store.. but just that you got to handle it with care..
",5
8169,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Overall, I am satisfied with the sound quality and design of this earphone. The only thing which I didn't like was that the wires are very thin and am just hoping that they don't get tear up.

Had a confusion on authenticity at first but it was sorted out at much ease by the customer support .. Only thing I don't like with this one is the normal wire..

8201,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great crystal clear sound , bass is on the softer side so  not recommended for people whose first priority is hard bass sound . For me , bass is perfect , you can keep listening to songs for hours without even any stretch to your ears . Also the ear pods are designed in such a way that it fits your ear perfectly . Also , it comes in handy when you can receive your calls and start pause or change music tracks with the call button .

8202,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"They do perform good, and sound quality is at par, build quality is not an issue until mishandled.So, overall, it is an in-budget, good quality, and quite useful piece for you.

8212,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Noise cancellation is pretty bad
",3
8213,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"At this price Skullcandy Smokin buds 2 is a better option. The bass in this thing is seriously overhyped and sounds kinda tinny/metallic. And purists will hate it. Wire quality is also thin and flimsy. No support under the earbuds. Might easily come off. User of skullcandy and Beats since 10 years. Got 8 pairs of skulls and 2 of beats. I bought it because of the convincing reviews but I'll stick to Skullcandy 💀 💀 💀

8214,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I expected better quality of sound, but it's OK. Fortunately it comes with the 90 degrees additional plug, otherwise I would not be able to use it in my 7inch tablet. That plug on other hand should not be used when plugging into a laptop or other mp3 player that I have. The wires are bit thin but with proper care should hold.

They solved my problem throughly.

8265,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Excellent delivery by Amazon. Sound clarity is awesome.I have many used headphones before this. It's my first canal phone. To get most out of it, make sure that it fits perfectly in you ear. I didn't know this, so I didn't get the bass, until one of my friends made me realise this. I don't want to compare it with anything, all I want to say is that I had the best music experience with this. For me its full paisa wasool xD

8274,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have used this earphone with my Oneplus One! Sound quality is good, low and mids are clean. Bass is decent for an earphone of this range.Though the mic quality is bad, sound coming from mic is bad, most of the time people on the otherside over call complain about sound quality!Now im thinking is it just me who's facing the issue or it's common issue..

8275,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Enjoying the quality of sound.... It's better than most I have used in the past.. Wire is thin be careful but it also provides pouch to carry earphones that good thing .....

",3
8278,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I thought the headset would be great but frankly, this piece is over rated. I regularly use sennheiser products and this one by far has the worst sound quality. Use the PX-80 if you need good quality . If you need a headset with a microphone then philips has a good option in the SHE range.
",2
8279,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Music reproduction not v good. Bass is not good. The song ""dheere dheere..."" has very low freq and this doesnt play it well. Now have Sony xb50ap and this is much better than Sennheiser. Need to try momentum series and that may be better.

8283,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have used cx180 as well and I would recommend cx180 over 275s only if mic is not important for you sound quality is excellent in both earphones though I  felt that cx275s has a bit more improved but is hardly a difference to notics considering the cost difference. Cx180 fits amazingly in your ears that where cx275 gets a low hand. Overall for me cx180 has a upper hand if you are not going for the mic

8294,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I have both the CX275 and the CX180. Both of them are excellent earphones. The only peeve I have about the 275 is the cables are a bit thinner and more prone to tangle than the 180.

8295,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Quality is good but you cannot listen with full volume on. Treble is comparatively higher than bass. Should reduce the treble. I don't know whether can it be adjusted with an equalizer

8309,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The wires are thin and little too delicate. You have to handle them with care. The pouch that this comes with is really handy. A good set of headphones. Just that it needs to be handled with care, always!

I bought it for Rs.1300 because I need a Mic if you don't need a mic then Sennheiser CX 180 Street II In-Ear Headphone (Black) is good when compared to other earphones without mic and it comes in the range of Rs600-Rs800.

8385,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Cable is not so durable using from last 4 month and one side had stopped working.
",3
8386,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Pros :* Solid sound quality* Perfect noise cancellation* The extra 3.5mm jack converter, 2 year warranty, buds and leather bag are great to have* Mic is greatCons :* Might hurt a bit after few hours.* Wire ""appears"" to be delicate.
",4
8387,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"2/3 rd money I paid was for brand value and a pouch to keep the headset.It is loud and sensitive. But overall hearing experience is not better than Sony at the same price.I think, if you want to feel real Sennheiser effect, your budget should be much high. In this price range, Sony is the best.
",4
8388,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"What to say about this product.  If you have brand name like sennheiser I dont think that will ever disappoint you. Sound quality is amazing for this range.  I required a mic thats why preferred this one. Bass is also excellent . Overall a great experience using this product.
",5
8389,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound Results are OK when used on mobile..but when used with poweramp on mobile it completely blows u off.. Gives amazing results on devices with adjustable sound effects, blocks decent amount of noise though when u remove it  creates a vacuum in the ear,cord is too long for my liking must be reduced to 3/4 of current size,overall OK considering I paid rs1250 ..got better results on my Panasonic ear phones for half the price previously!!
",3
8390,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This is my go-to set of earphones. They feel flimsy, but last quite a while, if you take decent care of it. Sound quality is great as well. Not too high on the bass, and the mid and high ranges are well balanced. All in all, definitely worth the money.
",5
8391,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I am fully satisfied with the product. Yes, I need to use it with a bit care bcoz the joints are a bit weak, but still I can manage to do so, as the sound quality is just uncompromising. just loved it :D
",5
8392,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The product is good.  but when I scanned the QR code of the product, product it failed to prove its originality. Sound is good.  The cables cables seems little delicate.  Dont know how long it will last.

8397,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound effect is low when compared to skull candy method which I used earlier. When I sing and record with this one, the quality is not that good.

8399,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's an amazing earphone it's just the wire is very fragile

8400,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The job for which it is made, it does the best. Its a great earphone and I love the sound. The only bone of contention I have is the build which not that subtle that i expected. The build feels a bit plastic type. Otherwise its great.

",3
8402,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nice clarity but wires not tangle free.
",4
8403,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Product quality is really good, can't comment on the sound quality yet, just been two days, as of now sound too muddy and unpleasant. I would prefer waiting for a few more days before posting a proper review.
",5
8404,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"awesome product but too expensive. 99% noise reduction, excellent comfort to the ears still with proper fitting. only thing with amazon is that no separate invoic bill or garantee card was available with the package which would be a problem while claiming anything under warranty. overall product was good but without garantee card or invoice bill there is a lack on the side of amazon service
",4
8405,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The sound and mic quality are better but the quality of wire is not at all good. Within 5months the wire started breaking out from the jack end.

8406,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The earphone packing is a little loose, one can see a little bit of magnet in the earphone packing. Besides that, Everything is good and best upto the expectation

8407,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Great performance as expected, however the wires are a bit too thin and there's no volume control ... other than that the noise isolation and sound quality is great.

8408,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Delivery, product and sound quality is totally good if you are a music lover is the best in this price range go no further if you trust, sennheiser never deliver bad user experience.
",4
8409,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Recieved the product about a week ago. Has very clear vocals, and just the right amount of bass. Wouldn't reccomend if you like too much bass.The only issue is that the wire appears to be a bit too thin, so they need to be handled with care.
",4
8410,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"First of all thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery.One of the best deep bass headphone u can get it on 1.7k . Noise cancellation is very good . Only thing is that wire can be little bit thicker other than that superb .

8411,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Durability is very bad. Never buy this earphone waste of money.After one year of use one side sound lost and replaced with warranty for 2 earphones both bought from amazon

8412,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Delivery within 24 hours. 5 stars for that.The wire of the earphones is very thin. Like very thin. But the sound quality is really amazing.  4/5 blocks outside noise.
",5
8413,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very good build quality. Cable is thin. Sound quality is great. But price is bit costly.  I choose this because of 2 years product warranty.

8414,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If you are in Delhi/NCR, The nearest service center is in Gurgaon. If you cannot visit the service center, you will have to take the pain to mailing the product with copy of your bill.The only think which is making me justify the cost I have incurred is the clarity, nothing else to say

8415,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The wire is thin but the sound quality is unmatched top notch quality go for it it's worth penny it's been a week in using it❤

8419,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I buyed this after facing ear pain caused by boat earphones, now I am not facing any problem but missing bass extremely. Only able to feel bass in quite environments.
",3
8420,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Bass quality is very crisp. Checked on bass tester on YouTube. These in-ears capture low frequency sound very well. I would rate them better then boat.

8421,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"If you have an ear for music, this is the product for you. Love it!
",5
8422,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not okay

8423,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"it has a very good sound quality, especially the call quality is excellent. for a good bass sound a proper size of the ear bud is necessary.

8425,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Excellent
",5
8426,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Nice product at this price. Can not compare to the expensive ear pods ,but then this one tops the list in this range.
",5
8427,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Almost a year since when I ordered them .. Still Running STRONG ! Even the carry bag provided is still scratch and scuff less ! Not so heavy on bass but adequate amount of it , which it makes up with its crystal clear audio .. Love them .. Ultra durable too ..
",5
8428,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"No issues.Dont expect too much.Just a decent grab.
",4
8429,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Very good balance between price and quality. Decent bass and treble can be heard. Remember  that the quality of the sound can only be as good as your recording of the mp3s. Low quality mp3 will give low quality output even on a very expensive headphone.
",5
8430,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Everything was good...But it wasn't compatable with my Motorola Mobile.
",2
8431,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This product is worth money. I will recommend for it. When the product was delivered the adapter that comes along with this was damaged. So, I had to return it. Buy without a doubt but check the adapter properly.

8432,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Quality is OK but not value for money
",3
8433,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I read all review before purchase, thought bass would be good but bass is not good. Sound clarity is good.
",2
8434,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's a good headphone set and it's worth every penny. But the storage pouch and small ear bud set was missing. Wondering whether it's a used thing or packing missed.
",4
8435,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These are good, but cx-180 are much better for music on the go, if you want to buy earphones for solely music purpose,  go for 180, go for these if you want to be able to take calls on the go as well. Also these are better in terms of build quality than jbl t100 or t150
",4
8436,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Excellent & Extraordinary product!!!
",5
8437,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"These are great for the price. Buy them if you are pressed for budget. And the pistons have more power but a little less clarity. Pistons are comfortable but fit a bit loose and give less isolation. And i mean pistons v4.
",5
8438,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound is best but the wire is very thin it is should also be best
",4
8439,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It's worst headphone I ever purchased... No sound quality no battery life... Its hard to hear the call as the call volume is too low compare to music volume... Even the wire is too short
",1
8440,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Material quality is good. Durability also good. Sound quality is not so good but its ok. Feels good on ear. Also it fits well in the ear. 4 years gone and its working like a charm.

",5
8446,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Then main problem of this earphone is its mic. It is very poor and also there is no controllers in the mic switch only call receiver switch is there.
",3
8447,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The durability is great. I have bought them twice
",5
8448,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Price is high as per quality and overall product. I would rather suggest some other good brands like JBL etc
",3
8449,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Not a showstopper. But decent product for regular use. Noise reduction is good. Bass is on the heavier side. Bit work needed on the upper volumes, but one can always use a good equaliser.

",5
8461,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Sound quality is too good. But it's too loose for the right ear. Comes out too often. I tried with different buds. Still not sticking to the ear properly.
",4
8462,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"The headphone is fine. But not as good as the headphones without mic in same brand. They were better. And the package was already open. The pouch was missing. Some one took it I think. That was disappointing. Amazon please check the product. The package was damaged I don't know if the headphones are, because I have used only for 3days.

8478,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"This product is great and I am purchasing it for the second time. Sound quality is really good, but the only downside of this product is the quality of the cable. It  looks very flimsy and my last one broke after 1 year.

8479,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"After listening to all types of music I can surely say this is the best Earphone in this range. After using Sony MDR-XB30EX In-Ear Extra Bass, these little babies just amped the music to a next level. Anyone confused between this and Sony MDR-XB30EX In-Ear Extra Bass just go for this.

So that it can be a good replacement for my old hTC headset.But after listening music on this, it's really more than I expected. The bass and the clarity of sound are awesome. Mic clarity also carries Sennheiser's quality. I have no idea what the sound quality would be on other mobiles. But as hTC mobile with beats audio sound output, I would definitely recommend these to buy.

8547,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"when it comes to performance it shows its class. but the built quality is poor. the gold plated jack gradually fades and is not working properly now. I've checked for any failure in wire.  but it is all fair..  i think the sudden failure of the headset is only cuz of the gold plated jack.

8560,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Good product at the range of 1500. Good bass relatable sound. The problem is with the wire of the earphone as it is very thin and can break easily. The merit of this earphone is it's 2 year warranty which is not given by any other brand

8720,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"It is an OK product. Cx 180 is better than this. Wire is very thin and Mic looks larger than earbuds. Sound is good but needed some bass.

8721,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"I was using samsung headphones earlier that came with my S3, so i could feel the difference immediately.Sound quality is good, fits perfect and noise cancellation feature is good.Bass goes haywire at high volumes, so don't go for this if you are into heavy metal stuff.

8725,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Wires are thin and delicate. Sound quality is terrible specially if compared to CX 180 which was the last model I used. This is definitely not worth the money.
",1
8726,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Everything is fine... bass, treble etc. Only flaw is that you cant listen for a long time as it gets uncomfortable for ears as the time passes. And avoid them while driving because of its fine noise cancellation
",4
8727,8,Sennheiser CX 6.0BT,"Its good. Lacks depth and sounds ashtray at times. But, its very good for everyday usage. Noise isolation is good, fits great and is comfortable even after prolonged usage.  At this price, I couldn't have asked for more. But, I wish it sounded a little bit tighter. Bass junkies would appreciate this pair definitely. Overall, very satisfied and would definitely recommend this product.

I tried comparing same music track with few Samsung and creative headphones and you can clearly make out the difference in sound effects . had good experience with seinheiser CX 180 street 2. Go for it if your budget of headphones is under 2K
