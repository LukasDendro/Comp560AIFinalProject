5183,3,Flybot Boom,"The earphones are of good quality, was looking for earphones in budget, have tried boult space but these are much better, the bass as per the name is perfect, the vocals are also clear and overall the sound is pretty good compared to 'boult space' in which you hear only bass and no vocals. The only thing which i didn't liked was the distortion at full volume but that much volume is not safe for human ear, For better experience keep the volume at 75%.The ratings are below :-Bass - 4.5/5Vocals - 4.5/5Fit - 5/5Bluetooth range - 4.5/5Battery - 4/5

5186,3,Flybot Boom,"The sound quality is nice at this rate..... But problem is with the battery..... In half n hour it came down from 50% to 20% and at 20% started saying that the battery is down and within one minute the the headphones got switched off which is extremely poor performance by the battery moreover the only indicator is when the battery is charging that from red colour it turns into blue colour but it does not auto cut off which is why you never know when it is fully charged or not....... Now waiting for after sales services since it has a 1 year warranty will have to see what and how fast is the services after sales...... Will update once any update comes from the manufacturer

5190,3,Flybot Boom,"Ear piece is too heavy. Not comfort to ear, so it fells down easily. Sound bass is very low. It does  ot meet expectation compare to its price. So i'll not buy again from the same company. I'm surprise how other buyer can give 5*. My big faults is that, I bought this product from viewing, comparing and making decision to buy this. I am very worried about my wrong decision.

5237,3,Flybot Boom,"Most of the I use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.Hence I decided I should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, So I did my research and decided on these, so Here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:Pro's:-It Comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-Battery lasts a long time.-It includes good packaging too.-Wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-The magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-Sound quality is actually quite good.-The contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-Useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-Noise canceling.-Sweat Proof.-Quite inexpensive.Cons's:-You have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""After these I have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, Very good product overall
