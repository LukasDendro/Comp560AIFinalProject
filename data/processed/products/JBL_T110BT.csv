12416,10,JBL T110BT,"Please do not buy this. Wired earphones worth 700 would give much better audio quality. No bass at all also very high treble kind of tweeter noise. Decided to return the product within the first 15 mins of use.

12417,10,JBL T110BT,"Not a good one .I have been using it from last couple of months.The sound quality is not good and also speaker volume level keeps decreasing.I want to exchange my device might be something is wrong with this device.

12419,10,JBL T110BT,"Got it in a deal for 1899/- and here are my thoughts.1. Connectivity and Range: Very Good. It powers on fast and pair easily & quickly, and I can even walk between rooms without any loss in signal or quality.2. Sound:  Decidedly average. It is definitely boosted, so if you do like punchy bass and are not particular about texture or accuracy, no problems. Sound better than almost anything that comes packaged with a smartphone. Distortion creeps in at 65%+ volume3. Usability:  They fit snugly, and isolate just enough so you can hear your music well but also know what's going on in traffic around you.4. Calls: Under normal circumstances these are fine. Person on the other side had some problem hearing me when I've used these while cycling.5. Battery: Good. I use them for about 2-3 hours a day and charge them every 3 days. They charge in a couple of hours and are good to go. Battery lasts for around 5-6hours on an average.Overall: Easy to recommend if you're only looking for an upgrade to generic earbuds and want to try wireless. Battery life and connectivity are great so no issues there. However, if you're primarily looking for a good listening experience, I'd say pass on this one.

12420,10,JBL T110BT,"Never buy this product...I personally suffer a lot. I have purchazed it on January and its August . Till date its mic got damage 4 times. Every time I have to visit to there customer service office and they took 15 days replacement time i.e totally I have lost 2 month for them. Out of 8 months 2 months this set was in there office. Any they don't bother. Simply stay away from JBL. Wrost product and bad experice overall from service team.

12421,10,JBL T110BT,"Awesome earphones. Good built quality. Good sound quality. Trustful brand. Good mix function. It takes less than 2 hours to charge actually. Worthy for this price.All the negatives comments out there are dependent on the way they use this product.Overall I love it.
",5
12422,10,JBL T110BT,"1. Sound management is bad. Sometimes the headphones are controlled separately by the haptic buttons on it, sometimes by the phone, so if a loud song comes along, it doesn't respond to the phone controls.2. The headphones are not heavy enough to stay on your shoulders while running and that makes it difficult to use them while running.3. Decent sound quality and battery management4. Okay for average use.

12423,10,JBL T110BT,"Listening to your neighbours blasting bhajan sangeet is a better wireless music experience than buying jbl. I hope God forgives these souls for making these earphones, because I know I can't. I am a JBL fan. I use a lot of their products like their sound bar, flip 4, wired earphones etc. They're all of wonderful quality and excellent durability. I saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon, but still bought them because I trusted jbl. But as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement. I've never been so disappointed in something before. I absolutely hated the sound. I thought I'll give it another day and voila, the earphones have the craftsmenship of a toddler's craft from pottery class. The earpiece was coming apart, not to mention how difficult it was to keep them in my ear without falling. Don't buy it. You sure deserve better. I'd wish this whole experience only on the worst of my enemies.

12424,10,JBL T110BT,"Software :The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is very good. Perfect for EDM lovers.The connection range does not extend to another room.Rarely, there are problems with connecting to the device, not a red flag.Hardware:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides about, may be a red flag for certain users.The magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is somewhat poor. The output of a fully charged device is less than 6 hours.Can't say much about durability now as it hasn't been long since I bought it. All I can say is, JBL has much better durability than Skullcandy.Overall:For its price, it's a catch.
",4
12425,10,JBL T110BT,"Got them for about 2K, and have been using more than a couple of hours each day. Definitely worth the price.Sound quality: Average, but that means it doesn't do anything terribly. The bass isn't as punchy, and the treble could have been more defined. But, there is no noise, so the mids come through clearly (perfect for my choice of music). The volume is a bit lower than wired earphones, but there is no distortion at peak volumes, not that it should be used at those. You could get wired earphones with similar sound quality at abt 1K, so that makes sense, considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware.Battery life: Now, this could be done better. Either the should have given a larger battery, or had better battery management software. It doesn't turn off if it is paired, but not used for an extended period. So, you have to make sure that you switch it off manually. Lasts about 4-5 hrs on less than 50% volume.Durability: uses flat wires, and the built ""seems"" sturdy. Definitely better than my Sennheiser earphones.Other features: call quality is decent enough. Mic is not that great, need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up a bit. Buttons are decent, and work without fail. There is a bright LED on the control capsule, lets people know you can't hear them. Wire is a bit too long, could've been a couple of inches shorter each side, but the balance is good. Fit snugly in your ear, doesn't fall out. The earphones bundle up nicely, and take practically no space in your pocket.Overall, given the price, meets my expectations. Wasn't expecting them to match something worth 6K or more, but doesn't disappoint for the money I spent.
",5
12426,10,JBL T110BT,"Not that much good as expected. Battery life is very much low as compared to other wireless headphones. If you have any other alternative to buy instead of this buy thatSound quality is good only btry life is issue
",3
12427,10,JBL T110BT,"A great buy except that you will not get Google assistant or siri support. Good for bike use too. Not for runners . Good for gym. Best for Bollywood music. As usual JBL sound. Must buy if you are into Bollywood or general youtube and calls user. Calls are also awesome over this headset.
",5
12428,10,JBL T110BT,"One of the worst sounding speakers ever I have purchased in my life. Road side ₹100 speakers sound much much better than this.The audio quality is so tinny, no base, no clarity just distorted pathetic sound.Don’t u even think of answering your wife’s call on this one as she might misunderstand u for saying something else as the audio is so poor the other person is always like “Say what now”...

12429,10,JBL T110BT,"Dear Amazon I am dealing with you from very long time but this time I think I get used and defected product because right side ear phone is not working and seal pack was opened I am very disappointed this time I order this device on my friend address so I don't think so I can't change it  and I will not deal with Amazon again.....

12430,10,JBL T110BT,"I m a bass lover and reading the reviews i was confused to purchase it or not but i trusted jbl brand and purchased it.Sound quality is good. Bass is sufficient to feel the vibrations and thump. You can purchase this without any 2nd thought
",4
12431,10,JBL T110BT,"Sound quality is excellent, connect it any phone you will get the same range of output.. connected to my old honor 4c which has worst earphone output in that phone I was getting best sound output on this JBLT110BT... Talking about the battery it depends on your usage, If you use it continuesly without switching off it would last upto 6 hours... If you use it time by time and turn off in between the running time wouldn't more than 5 hrs. ..The one thing I didn't like about is the length of the cable.. it bit longer for no use and it doesn't fit on your neck for no reason... But still we can compromise that.It would give 4.5 star out of 5..

12432,10,JBL T110BT,"I purchased this product a month ago & before to complete its first month, one of the ear-bud stopped working .This was never expected from a brand like JBL !! Amazon return policy gets over within 10 days but then to search for JBL Service Center is a very painful task.JBL has a single Service Center in each city, so very bad 'After-Sale-Service' !! (if you are not lucky)Even after visiting the Service Center, you are asked to submit your defective product & to come-back after 15days to get your product !! (Till the time its time of frustration !!)If possible, please dont go for this Product. Sound quality is also not attractive...

12433,10,JBL T110BT,"Writing this review after a year and a half of really rough usage.I have been taking this headphone where ever I go it survived falling down on roads and in the rain ,I have to tell I am really impressed with the build quality and the price was really reasonable.After one year of thrashing and rough usage it finally gave in this week even the charge lasted much longer than usual and charging time was also really less.I would recommend this to anyone due to its superb build quality and long lasting battery.Coming to the sound quality I would give it 5 stars as being a frequent traveler I have no issues and the Bluetooth connectivity is also fast.I wear this earphones inside my helmet and am still able to hear  anything without any problem around traffic.
",5
12434,10,JBL T110BT,"Product has zero bass ( BASS and TREBBLE are not balanced) , TOTAL WASTAGE OF MONEY .if u are long  time music listner, and like to listen bass , DONT GO FOR IT ,.......Don't know why it's marketed by the name PURE BASS ....it should be sold by name PURE TREBBLE as  BASS is missing from the product.
",1
12435,10,JBL T110BT,"Bought the product despite some reviews I saw on Amazon that the headphones doesn't produce bass.For me, the product is a good one. Have true pure bass, but only when it is inserted deeply into the ear channel. When the ear plugs are simply kept into the ears, you could hear only treble and no bass.Overall a good product.
",5
12436,10,JBL T110BT,"Sound quality is just awesome. I bought it as gift for a teenager and he loved it. Also price is good for great product company of JBL.A shorter wire length would have been ideal

12437,10,JBL T110BT,"Sound quality is not good & it's to long
",3
12438,10,JBL T110BT,"Automatically disconnects after a certain period of time without any kind of notification. The connection also goes off when a phone call comes in and you choose the option to talk without the earphones - after the call ends, you would have to reset the bluetooth connectivity all over again.The sound quality and noise cancellation features are good enough with respect to the price of these earphones.
",3
12439,10,JBL T110BT,"Didn't even last for a year.Durability is least.The right earpiece broke (Thanks to my nephew)If taken care with proper care might last for 2 years(max).We have two in our house.One had to be replaced again due to non functioning of one side.The other one is the one I'm reviewing.Sound quality was top notch though.Battery backup is decent with 4-5 hours of continuous playback.Charging to 100% takes more than an hour.Verdict- Don't buy this crap, spend some more rupees and get a better quality one.

12440,10,JBL T110BT,"Got this in Jan 19 and worked very well with excellent excellent quality as expected from JBL. What was not expected is the product lasted just 50 days and all of sudden mic stopped working, - volume button turned hard and could not press. When I tried pressing it the cover flicked off.Contact JBl customer and they were polite enought to guide me to service centre. Reached service centre and surprisingly I was told that there was a physical damage. I told that top cover just flicked when I pressed the volume button little hard. The service centre guy and JBL call centre guys told that it is a use and throw product and under one year it is just replacable. Sincerely with damaged they cannot process the warranty. I think ,  Even a small damage, they will reject the warranty claim. I think they expect the consumer to keep the product intact for a year. Not buying and recommending this anymore
",1
12441,10,JBL T110BT,"sound quality is not good and like trebleNo true bassI have two others JBL T110 and T210 and but this JBL110BT is not that level... it is average quality product...better to purchase from showroom with trial and tested..Finally not happy with this product and initiated for return not for replacement.
",2
12442,10,JBL T110BT,"Thanks to Amazon.Good sound quality.Bass and treble are well balanced. Perfect sound quality. Best ever I have heard till now. Even better than Sony, which lacks in crystal sound due to overpowered bass.Battery would have been better. But, the battery does not often charge due to some loose connection in the charging unit. I have to drop the full set on the floor thrice, so that the battery regains its charging capacity again.
",4
12443,10,JBL T110BT,"Very bad performance, hazing sound effect, automatically disconnect from the mobile even between the songs. Had to charge multiple of times. The body is slightly opened. I don't think this peice of garbage is waterproof
",3
12444,10,JBL T110BT,"As usual, there are some connectivity issues. The volume controller's placement is really bad. But it delivers a very good experience. Bass and Treble are perfectly balanced. Midtones and vocals are clear. Most importantly I can use this earphone while riding a 2 wheeler with my helmet on. Araaam see...

12445,10,JBL T110BT,"sound quality rost ...  my expectations is wrong . very bad voice quality ... and call voice  bad

12446,10,JBL T110BT,"Thinking JBL is a good brand, available at such a low cost , I bought it. However it was a bad experience. Neither the quality of sound nor the durability matches with the brand level..doubt if Amazon selling fake product..
",1
12447,10,JBL T110BT,"I was satisfied with this product and enjoyed using it but after 3 months the left ear piece started lowering the sound. I thought it must be the song quality and nevertheless kept hearing the songs. After about 10 months the sound from left ear piece stopped working all of the sudden. I know its not my mistake since i never used it in moist area not do i take it our during a workout. I have asked Both amazon and the Seller to replace the product for me when the warranty was valid and its been long since then and there's no response from both Amazon and the Seller.
",2
12448,10,JBL T110BT,"Sounds quality is good.noise cancellation not upto the mark as expected.Battery life is good.The microphone is somewhat placed slightly far, so you need to always pull forward to make sure the opposite person hears or speak louder.And the microphone stopped working completely in only 5 months, with no evident reason.Got it replaced, let's see the life of this now.

12449,10,JBL T110BT,"Useless product and useless service.. I have purchased this 1 month back.. Now its not working.. And now jbl Harman india compony  are not responding.. Their customer service is not giving any response and also they are not replying of my any mail.. Worst product ever.. Do not buy at any cost even if they are giving u for free..
",1
12450,10,JBL T110BT,"Gets disconnected every now and then. Sometimes it's not working with different apps. And there is disturbance in the sound. I asked Amazon to replace my order as it was in warranty period but they asked me to go to a JBL outlet. As I moved to different location it's very difficult because they don't have a showroom here.

12451,10,JBL T110BT,"If you don't care about sound quality and noise isolation, go ahead and buy these as they are built extremely well. Sound quality though, I regret buying these.My forst and Probably my last JBL product.

12452,10,JBL T110BT,"Eventing is working fine. Except there is no service center in pune. I need to send it to Mumbai for replacement.. they also didn't accept the courier.. after 6 months left side of my headphone is dead. I send it to my cousine to replace it. On same day I've got the replacement. The service is very good.
",5
12453,10,JBL T110BT,"I'm fed up with this Bluetooth earphone. JBL India has only one service centre in the country. I have couriered the earphone to the service centre located in Gurgaon, Haryana. And no response from the service centre. Really sad about the product.No service Available since the right hand side of the earphone stopped working. Not worth for money. Very low sound quality. Just good design only. Bad and not good enough. ₹2099 is extremely high for this. Better to sell for ₹500.

12454,10,JBL T110BT,"Am a regular user of JBL brand ear phones used more than 5models. Iam totally happy with this product easy to access and great battery life. Sound quality is good and great noise cancellation. Easily fitting in ears. Material used for the product is good.

12455,10,JBL T110BT,"Worst product from jbl . It doesn’t sound good. Though it is jbl’s Bass model of wireless Bluetooth but useless, no bass at all been feel. And it looks like local product. So this product is absolutely not value for money.
",1
12456,10,JBL T110BT,"The sound quality and noise cancellation both are good but I bought it two months back and this is the second time I got it replaced because it stopped working...JBL service is pathetic...they take their own sweet time(12-15days) to return the product.Also there is just a single JBL service center available in every city so it is a task to get it replaced if you live away from the center.
",1
12457,10,JBL T110BT,"Did not expect this kind of service from JBL and AMAZON too. Fake reviews. Durability is too poor. One side earphone speaker stopped working in just 2 months and i wrote to jbl. No action taken. Amazon also dont have any option for replacement when the product is in warranty.

12458,10,JBL T110BT,"Great wireless earphones. Used it at the gym, while driving and at office. Music sounds great and voice calls are good too. Don't go with the negative reviews. I don't know what people need out of an earphone. Good earphones and is solves  the purpose. Went with jbl at the back of my charge 2+ Bluetooth speakers.

12460,10,JBL T110BT,"Worst earphone I have ever seen, price is too much for this earphone after checking for two days I m returning this product. Price range should be 200-400 for this earphone.

12461,10,JBL T110BT,"Value for money ... felt something missing after all....  don’t know what’s missing ... frequencies /sound quality or I don’t know ... I didn’t get full satisafaction ... brands make cheaper prodcts to have less quality than premium... don’t know ...

12462,10,JBL T110BT,"I bought this as a gift for someone. It's got amazing sound quality. The bass isn't as heavy as I thought it would be. But I prefer it that way. Don't expect drum bursting bass. But it gets the job done for the price your paying.

12463,10,JBL T110BT,"The Product worked for really well for 2 Months, but post which the Product battery life is pathetic even after a sufficient amount of charge is done. I would like to return this product or opt for a buyback. Trust on JBL is blemishing. Hopefully management shall look into this and do the needful. Else I might have to look for a different solution.

12468,10,JBL T110BT,"Not for Bass lovers. I am not even one, but still would prefer a bit more bass. Also, it's not so comfortable to wear or stay on place if you would jog or run. It's annoying to keep adjusting, which otherwise a wired headset will be better.

12469,10,JBL T110BT,"2 months after purchasing the earphones, the left speaker's sound subsided. And not long after the right side went off completely.Sound isn't too bad but I wouldn't call it greatWas highly disappointed by the earphones after spending so much on something that didn't even last 6 months

12470,10,JBL T110BT,"Its not too useful, there are better options available from other companies like boat. Plus the blue light continuously is lit. It kind of is a negative point.

13934,10,JBL T110BT,"Was a big fan of JBL untill i received this product. The sound was not upto the mark. the voice on calls was pathetic as the reciever was hearing loud noises other than my voice. Bass was not proper. better to go with a wired earphone instead of buying this. It was looking so big on neck and was not manageable for runs and workout. Immidiately ordered return and amazon took lot many days to first return it and i am stil waiting for my money to be processed so that i can order a different earphone.

13935,10,JBL T110BT,"Third class product and can't contact JBL customer support through call or email. Headphones battery doesn't hould charging even after charging overnight and it drains in few minutes feels like Amazon is good at  selling cheap products nor JBL or Amazon is ready to take responsibility.

13936,10,JBL T110BT,"This is my personal experience with this product.I own JBL stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! Weird. Really disappointed by the quality. The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made ₹150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing. Totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.PS : I tried this product on the One Plus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9+ and also on an iPhone 7+ and it was all the same.

13937,10,JBL T110BT,"there is a serious pairing issues with this headset. I was facing this issue for quite some time that while talking on call headset pairing breaks with my phone. i have tried it with other phone as well thinking it could be a device specific intermittent issue but story remained unchanged. additionally, i have testify it another friend of mine who recently purchase it and he stamped on this issue.would want to return it but my returning duration is lapsed. I am stuck with this faulty piece. :(have bought on a higher price than Portronics (becuase of brand image, JBL) but regretting now. :( :(
",1
13938,10,JBL T110BT,"Awesome product. Battery backup is about 5 1/2 - 6 hours when i am using it continuously. Have been using it for more than 3 months. No issues faced. If your usage is within 5 - 6 hours at a time my suggestion go for it. Voice is clear when speaking, lightweight. Bass & sound quality is great but does depend on the app you are using in your phone to listen to music. I have tried with JIO music, Amazon music, jet player etc. Most of the players gave excellent output. I guggest try with different players or equalizer settings to get the perfect audio. The wires are tapered in shape hence can sustain a little bit of stress. 3 different size of earbuds are available with this product and selecting the correct size does not allow the buds to fall off (Tried it when running on a treadmill). All in all awesome product at this price.
",5
13939,10,JBL T110BT,"Terrible Bass. This product does not justify the name given to it. I bought a Portronics Por-766 Conch 204 along with this set, just as a spare, cost me some 400 or something which has a better output than the JBL. I wouldn't reccommend this product if you want to listen to music.I cannot believe I fell for this brand and model name like this. I wish I hadn't bought the product.
",1
13940,10,JBL T110BT,"Pros: Crisp sound. Good bass. Good volume range.Cons: Works smoothly for the first month or two. Post that you realise that there are connection issues due to minor obstructions like fabric or even if device is obstructed by a body part (neck or hand), so the sound falters. Initially I could keep my mobile in my trouser pocket and listen to the music, but later on there was so much of connection stability issues, I had to hold it in my hand or keep it in direct, unobstructed range from the device. You can also see a drastic dip in the range between device and the headset over a period of time.Eventually, it pretty much becomes as good as a regular earphone, because of the way and distance you have to place your device from you phone or laptop.I had to replace it after 4 months (it was in it warranty period). The condition of the replaced product is the same now. Might get it changed again, I think, because its still in the warranty period. The good part about their service centre is that they replace it without asking questions, as long as you have the valid invoice with you.
",3
13941,10,JBL T110BT,"After a long research to get my BT Headset in the price rage of Rs.2000, I finally landed with this one. I'm happy about this choice. I explored Ant, Tagg and other brands but the JBL brand value and its wider service network given confidence. Surely it's simple yet powerful headphone. very elegant design, no non-sense outfit. Perfect for several hours of music. It is having magnetic lock, which is not mentioned in the product page. In the pack, it has different sized three pairs of ear-bud caps, the subtle Orange in the ear-buds presents its beauty very presently. As far as sound concern, it is JBL. I already own speaker and over-head phone from JBL, which are performing for several years consistently. This also proves its quality. Good bass and clarity, even in minimum to maximum volumes. If you have high resolution audio files, it is perfect companion. The mic placement is not friendly and no carrying pouch is given so, I deduct one star for it.

13942,10,JBL T110BT,"They sell calling it pure bass.. extra bass earphone..Which it is surely not.. even JBL Equalizer app isn't recognizing it.

13944,10,JBL T110BT,"It stopped after a month of working.Cahrging stopped. Warrenty is not supported from the amazon you have to rush to the JBL service center to get replace. Sound qualityis good but not great. Just a ordinary headphones at the such cost.

13945,10,JBL T110BT,"I don't need to talk about the quality of the product...duh!,  it's JBL, so obviously the sound quality and bass are awesome and upto the expectations. The only problem (s) I faced were that it's wire is way too long for a Bluetooth device. Sometimes it creates problems. On top of that, the right side earpiece stopped working after just 1 month of use. Since it was under warranty I ordered for an exchange.

13946,10,JBL T110BT,"I don't know if Amazon people have started selling fake products but I  deeply disappointed by the product. It abruptly stopped working after 15 days of purchase & I can't even return it. I have ended up wasting my 2000 bucks

13948,10,JBL T110BT,"Battery life is Good but expected a little more from JBL in terms of sound quality.Yes, Tested this with youtube, inbuilt music player of phone and play music app. You will get the real bass only when you tweek the settings to bass boost @ 100 in equiliser of play music app.Rest the build quality is good and product is 100% genuine...Fitting in ear is good and both the earbuds are magnetic enables you to carry them around your neck easily.To wrap up; If you need a decent pair of earphones with not boomy heavy bass but optimum bass then go for it !

13956,10,JBL T110BT,"The Earphones are decent to listen music. To Receive calls, the voice echoes. More so,the length of the chord could have been a little shorter as it's length is a little bigger for a Bluetooth earpiece. Rest, Noise cancellation is good. And Thanks Amazon for timely delivery :).

13957,10,JBL T110BT,"It comes with medium ear buds default.Not good for bass lovers, although JBL says it's pure bass. Not pure or extra bass. When pressed with hands tightly, we can feel some bass.Sony Extra bass lovers not buy this product.Treble is bit more even the equilizer is adjusted.Jbl : Hear the truth, their tag line.That is true for every jbl product.I think I'll love this headset gradually.Some adjustments are made. First replace medium ear bud with small size bud. It places tightly in the ear. Thus feel more bass

13959,10,JBL T110BT,"In ₹2000 price range its a fair purchase. The sound quality though is not that up to mark, at least not what I expect from JBL. Its not Pure Bass as it says its just a lot of Treble and I hate it. Overall its OK just turn on the EQ and change it to Bass Booster but it will lower the volume a little and you can hear the outside world clearly. The design is neat and very attractive but the placement of the mic is not a suitable position. The Bluetooth sometimes disconnects when multitasking. I faced this problem while I was playing PUBG and suddenly someone called when I picked up the phone it disconnected that is very annoying every time as you have to go through the Bluetooth settings to reconnect. Rest its all right. Afterall we should not forget we are getting all that in ₹2000. So that’s quite okay. Its not a compromise its a good purchase.

14065,10,JBL T110BT,"This is the best bluetooth headphone I've found in this price range and this has come new in the market recently. Specially the magnet ting in the ear pieces are awesome, it's the most helpful thing.In the box it says ""Pure bass"", bass is not that high but audio clarity with effects is really good. While listening to some tracks I feel that treble is little high but that I've solved by using equalizer on my phone. It took me about 1 hr 40 mins to charge and goes on full day well.The wire which is at the rear (neck area) should've been a little longer and front ones a little short because it's sometimes difficult to find the buttons for changing songs or picking up the call.But overall according to my experience JBL is always the best. No matter what product you buy from them their music quality is always the best.

No doubt this product seems to you very attractive and it should be at last it's Jbl product.But friends don't buy this product from amazon, this is not a genuine productAfter 28 days of purchasing this product, it started showing charging productsNo matter how much u charged it will not last for more than 5 minutes and guys amazon will not at all help you to get this product refundAnd you have to contact the jbl service center which is really very much hecticMy point of purchase is amazon but they simply denied to help me furtherPlease don't waste your money and time2000 rupees is not a small amountIt's get time to earn this money and entire money will go in to vain

14096,10,JBL T110BT,"I am extremely disappointed with the product. It was on sale...but I did not realize it was a defective/old piece. The battery life has deteriorated within two weeks of its purchase. It discharges within 10 mins of a full charge. This is not acceptable because we did not want a old piece when we ordered at a good price. Bad publicity for the brand
",1
14097,10,JBL T110BT,"Pros: Functional, does the job, fits very well in the ear insulating external sounds well, good range, good build quality, good for workouts.Cons: Very average bass. If you have experienced something like Sony MDR-XB55AP, then you can't settle for this sound at this price.Verdict: Best bluetooth buds at this price. But Sony MDR-XB55AP or even Skullcandy offer much better sound at this price. So if you're an audiophile, looks elsewhere.

14099,10,JBL T110BT,"I got it for 1900 and believe me you can't get any better bluetooth earphone on this budget...  Noise cancellation is great, before reaching top volume your ambience will be mute doesn't matter how much noise is there... Sound quality is great in a quite place you can't listen to top volume (if you're not a hard core Metallica fan, for them no headphone has enough sound). The bass is the main highlight of this earphone, you can enjoy every beat of music. Great pricing from JBL. highly satisfied... 5/5 points...

14100,10,JBL T110BT,"The product is not working as it don't detect to my phone honor 6x and not playing music in it . you can't use it as regular ear phones, while using right ear is painful on continuously usage.

",5
14102,10,JBL T110BT,"this device here received a tons of negativity on Amazon and other sites but just a quick note that when we shift from wired to wireless the sound quality really affects so if we have to compare we should do it with other wireless earphones not the wired one .The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is good. Perfect for EDM lovers Electronic dance music.The connection range is amazing .It's really easy to connect to new deviceson the physical overview, it has got a really big neckband which is kind of annoying most of the times and it has 3 buttons - one to play and pause  music or receive call or end and the other two to change the music as well as to change volume, depending the time u press those keyswhen we talk about the looks of the device it looks good if you are wearing a shirt or a t-shirt with a collar so u can hide the neck ban in the collar if not then it's uncomfortable and also looks awkward at the same timeat a price point of 2000rs and jbl branding it is a fair pricetime for the big deal the pros and conspros;Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is good. The output of a fully charged device is around 6-8 hours  depending on the volumebuild quality is amazingCons:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides aboutThe magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.bass is not much as jbl devices are known for high bassThis is a great device but the wireless earphones lacks in either sound/battery/looks/comfort and this one lacks in comfort

",5
14111,10,JBL T110BT,"well i would give it (4-1)star for a reason... sound is really good and with deep basss but with a catch here. i had bought the headphones and was very disappointed for a flat bass and lots of treble sounded waste of 2k... but then i had spare ear buds of sony mdr wired earphones (spare buds) which were perfect fit on jbl ones and woah the sound felt amazing really worth the jbl sound series..... well the biggest problem is with the too hard ear buds provided with dosent give full isolation to bass effe t to shape...so people who have already bought try replacing the earbud with any old headphone you have which are useless
",3
14112,10,JBL T110BT,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, these earphones are great. Have been using them daily for about 3 hours a day for the last 4 months and they are close to perfect.I use Audio Technica m50x for listening to music for the most part. Bought these JBL Bluetooth ones for use where the m50x is too bully to carry.Pros:Charge lasts about 5 hours.Lightweight.Produces very clear sound.Bluetooth range is quite high, at least 15 metres in my experience.Cons:Slightly more expensive than I'd have liked, I paid 2250...Microphone is placed near your shoulder so taking calls can be a little irritating. People keep telling me I sound like I'm far away.

14121,10,JBL T110BT,"With so many fake JBL earphones doing rounds in the market, I decided to buy one from Harman, instead of Amazon. Original with all serial numbers.Trust me, to my sheer disbelief the audio quality was very poor. Crap. I asked for a replacement. After much ugly dialogues got it replaced after 2 months. A little bit of improvement in audio output. No bass. Squeezed sound. Throw your money into the sea, instead of buying this peice of s**t.

Then took them to the service centre in nehru place  where in their customer register all the complaints were related to this product only. As far as the customer care service is concerned, it is way more worse than the product because Jbl take ages to replace your product as for mine they took 20 days for the replacement. Then again the new earphones stopped working within a month.So, as a genuine user of this product I would not recommend anyone to go for these earphones as it has some manufacturing defect within the device itself.

14128,10,JBL T110BT,"I bought expensive tiny monster from Croma a year ago. In just one year and 6-7 days, one side of the earphone stopped working. worst part is yet to come. I expected at least a repair by paying a few bucks after surpassing 1 year warranty deadline at the authorized service centre which again is just one in whole gujarat state. But to my shock they denied repairing and when I called their customer care they justified it with all silly reasons for not repairing.  So in the end it is just a cheap use and throw pairs of earphone with over 2000 Rs. price tag.  JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS TINY MONSTER and go for any other cheaper brand.

14142,10,JBL T110BT,"This is a decent earphone considering the sound quality, brand value and cost. Don't expect thumping bass response from its 8.6 mm driver, the sound is not flat or full though. Give it some time to burn in the speaker to get the real sound of it. The call quality is horrible with this , you just can't roam around the rooms and talk, also the mic position is problematic. The build quality is average and is made of plastic, the wire is tangle free and of good quality. My first set have one of its speaker casing fall out of place, so have to order a replacement. Overall, it's a decent earphone.
",3
14143,10,JBL T110BT,"hey guys. bought it. used it. has a bass boost apparently, but it doesn't seem bassy enough for some reason. my Samsung wired headphones were better on that aspect. plus if ure planning to use it for running, dont buy this. the wireless aspect is not helpful as the wires keep bouncing in front of your face. tooo cumbersome to keep pushing them away during runs.

14144,10,JBL T110BT,"Guys jbl earphones are absolutely good with audio.. but as per service center it's very bad and disappointing. Don't dare to buy the jbl electronics if there was no service near you.I hope you will understand this problem the worst experience I have faced with JBL Harman India.
