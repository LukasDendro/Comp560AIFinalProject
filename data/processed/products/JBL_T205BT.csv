5766,7,JBL T205BT,"I was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.I then came across the JBL Tune 205BT randomly and I did not find any reviews online.I took the plunge and bought it. Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I’ll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now, the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple’s earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said, I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity, Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good, I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls, I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

5767,7,JBL T205BT,"Even though, the Sound Quality and In Ear design is good, for couple of Ergonomic reasons, I am not satisfied with the following Features in the Ear Phones:1. Skipping/Changing songs- Very difficult. need to Hold for 2 Secs to change- Which is  very difficult while you are on a  jog/fast run. Need to completely slow down and Hold the Button.2. Volume Changing Button is inside and it takes couple of seconds to locate the VOlume Button and Press. Tedious and Very much iritating.3. The Driver Set and Mic Piece is very large and and heavy and which makes the ear piece to fall off while on a run/Jog.4. There is NO option for Clipping to our sports wear to avoid a Fall off.I had faced this Troubles More number of time in first 1 hour of the usage.  I feel my Present Iphone wired Earphones are the best.Please consider this feedback and have some deign Modification.I dont have Any Feedback on the Seller. Seller Communication  and Delivery was Perfect and very much Satisfied.I have requested for the Refund for Earphone.

5770,7,JBL T205BT,"I'm not happy with this product. If you've use JBL earphones before, you won't get feel like JBL from this product. I've purchased this product in ""Rs 2399""💰 but made quality is not like the price. And important topic is, after every few minutes it'll automatically disconnect from device you connected if you get any call. Sometimes it unable to response when we've to power off the earphones. If you're reading this don't buy this product, go for another one otherwise order from JBL OFFICIAL SITE, you'll get low price also.

5771,7,JBL T205BT,"I used it with OnePlus 6. The sound quality is very poor. There is no way you can increase the sound output.The built is okay. Earphones fit nicely in the ear.Also there is issue of music not playing after a call in between.Overall suggestions don't buy it. No point in purchasing when you can't hear music.

5772,7,JBL T205BT,"My first JBL earbud. Straight to point :1 Sound quality - It's pretty good, clarity and tones. No thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones.  But you will get good bass, notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

5773,7,JBL T205BT,"The product i recieved is not even original. This is really disappointing i saw the same earphones at croma which were genuine and sound quality was way better than these. Material used for this product is awful.

5774,7,JBL T205BT,"I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved, however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range, works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile

5775,7,JBL T205BT,"Bought this 1 month back. Very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. But lacking few important features. 1) No multipoint connection. You can pair to only one device at a time 2) No auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. It drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) No magnet in the backside of the earbuds. So, you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.I am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because, my 1200Rs BT earbuds is having these features built in. Hence giving 3* even though I like the sound quality.

5776,7,JBL T205BT,"First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

5778,7,JBL T205BT,"The earphones don't fit my ears!Within 2 hours of delivery, I called back amazon for a return. But they said return would only be done for a damaged product, so I've to ""live with it"" even if it doesn't fit my ears and I've to hold it with both my hands to keep it in place!Moreover it's extremely UNCOMFORTABLE as there is no rubber.Sound quality seems decent but unfortunately they are so loose in My ears that I'm unable to judge it well. Most of the sound goes out of my ears!The description said its metal earphones, but somehow it feels plastic, so I Don't want to fondle with it too much.Customer care said I could buy some ear clips so that they stay on my ears but I'm not able to find a correct match for it.

5779,7,JBL T205BT,"1. You have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. Battery comes around 3-4hours.3. Comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. It is bit large than it supposed to be.4. Sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. I give 35 marks for sound quality.5. Device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . In that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. Bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. If you are in different room it is not connecting.Finally compare to level U, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level U. Because my level U got broken in the middle and Bluetooth is connecting now. This earphones are idea for listening some stuff in YouTube but not recommended for music lovers.

5780,7,JBL T205BT,"Product got delivered on 03-Feb-2019. Microphone stopped working after one month in first week of Mar-2019. Today is 3th April, exactly from last 1 month i am searching for service center which accept headphones repairs and trying to get in touch in with JBL officials; however i am not able to due pathetic JBL after sales service. They claim they do not handle headphones nor do they revert to mails (send to customer care and service center guys).Update: After almost one month of following up with Jbl, I received brand new headphones.Happy with it. But customer service is slow to respond.

5784,7,JBL T205BT,"I am writing this review after using these headphones for 3months.Though JBL is a brand name but this headset has connectivity issue. I tried using them on different occasions but they failed to prove JBL as a brand. Sound is good but the start and pause button has started giving me trouble at time does work.

5785,7,JBL T205BT,"Well sorry to say that  the sound quality is good. But its not worth buying it lacks the basic functionality of a good headphone.I want to return itThe battery life is so pathetic that it never lasts more than 3 hours. I previously owned sansung level U and i miss the 2 day battery life. Ease of use and the way it connected.This one disconnects automatically and then has to be turned off and on many times.I hate it i hate it do not buy. Instead go for Samsung level U.

5786,7,JBL T205BT,"Didn't like the product earbuds, they are not at all comfortable. Asked my few other friends to try it on, even they said not comfortable. Starts paining in the ear after 20 mins of usage, which results into massive headache.Also there's no return policy from Amazon nor JBL as well.Feels like both companies doesn't care about customer complaint.My suggestion would be to buy another model except this.

5787,7,JBL T205BT,"I would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.At first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

5788,7,JBL T205BT,"Tired of reading? Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

5789,7,JBL T205BT,"Ordered these because of the Apple earpod like eartips, which I prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. They fit really well in my ears. Very comfortable to carry them around the neck. Sound quality is very good...not too high bass, but not too low as well. They are very soothing to the ears. Noise cancellation is not that good...but I'm not that bothered about that.

5791,7,JBL T205BT,"I was looking forward to buy something which fits like apple airpods. Eversince I came back to android eco system I missed my airpods.  I don't like those in ear type earphones.  I tried mi earphones,  oneplus bullets wireless & Samsung galaxy buds ( horrible call quality!) Nothing I liked.  But these are awesome.  Great to wear,  no strain as they are very light weight.

5792,7,JBL T205BT,"These bluetooth headphones are awesome, JBL keeps the sound experience great as always. Pure bass, clear, and crisp trible.

5793,7,JBL T205BT,"A great product from JBL, as a Bluetooth earphone it's really good, no connection issue, good noise cancellation, good bass and vocals.

Connect well with laptop but sometimes it's gives fraction of second beep sound but no issues with mobile devices.

5794,7,JBL T205BT,"One of the most uncomfortable headphones I tried.Actually, I bought this from Amazon with feeling that I can return if I didn't like the product (and I confirmed the same from one customer care executive). But, when I tried to raise return request it was denied. I told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which I can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. He was just insisting that I should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately I went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). Regarding product, if it fits your ear fine I think you will love this product. If you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.

5795,7,JBL T205BT,"Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery, it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

Just a piece of tape cut from tape machine.4. Quality of material used for making body of earphones is quiet cheap.I'm don't have second thoughts to, that these earphones are not genuine JBL.

5803,7,JBL T205BT,"One of those good bluetooth earphones in the market. Bluetooth connectivity is very good and the sound output is excellent.Perfect bass, no noise while listening to music with high volume. No sound distortion and mic is decent.  But sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt, so be careful. The battery backup is also good. You can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. I used JBL T210, but this provides better sound.Till now I didn't find any flaws in this earphone. I can say one thing - value for money, you wont regret buying this.

5807,7,JBL T205BT,"Hi,I Bought this item with lot of expectation and first impressions was good. I do not prefer ear bud headphones hence I bought this one. Within 5 months rubber covering of right earbud removed autimatically ( glue issue ) when I check the same for left, its also having adhesion issue. I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only. This is not earbud type hence I cannot have a replacement other than throw my headset. Thankyou JBL for selling a non durable product.

5811,7,JBL T205BT,"Superb sound quality and decent battery life. I am completely satisfied with this fantastic product from jbl. I had purchase a boat 230 rockerz earphone and was extremely disappointed with it. But this one from JBL is a fantastic product and quite good looking. You can go for it without any issues.

5813,7,JBL T205BT,"I wanted an comfortable Bluetooth earphones. So I chose this design, and I am happy with my decision.Good sound, not too loud nor too muddyBass is very adequateI use it mostly for callsWatching YouTubeAnd sometimes Music.Battery is somewhere around 4-5 hrs.

5814,7,JBL T205BT,"This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a “In-Ear” type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery’s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can’t expect Noise Isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

5815,7,JBL T205BT,"Can't believe this is a JBL product. Not suitable for running due to the charging port and volume blocks being heavy causing the wire to bounce around while running and eventually pull the earphones off. Terrible!!Sound quality is also very average.Boat, Phillips are definitely better. Spent a lot of money on this and now no return option.

5816,7,JBL T205BT,"Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. I think it has noise installation not cancellation. Overall it is OK, except the mic and noise cancellation.Noise installation: 5 🌟Noise cancellation: -5 🌟Mic : -1 🌟Sound : 4 🌟Bass: 4 🌟Battery🔋: 4🌟Build quality: 2.5🌟Charge time: 4 🌟

5817,7,JBL T205BT,"Sound quality is average. After a month it stopped working. They have no after sale service. They ask for the device and never send it back. Its not worth a lot of money but crooks should be taught a lesson so i will file a police complaint. I’ll neevr recommend you to buy this.

5818,7,JBL T205BT,"Recently i bought JBL Tune205 BT. The quality of the sound is great and comfortable to use for long usage. The earbuds are same as iPhone earphones. The reason for 3 stars is because it doesn't work with imo/viber/messenger voice calls. During the voice calls on these apps the sound comes through mobile speaker not the Bluetooth earphones, but on regular mobile calls it works perfectly fine.

5819,7,JBL T205BT,"JBL has launched an affordable bluetooth headset without compromising on the sound quality... Though a few days later, the richness of the audio has dropped and the rubber pads in the earpieces has come off... bottomline... sound quality is above average but build quality is bit on the fragile side.
",4
5820,7,JBL T205BT,"For being priced at INR 2,199 (that is how much I got it at) it clearly lacks the JBL standard. I haven't yet tested the battery life or noise cancellation but I'm not concerned about them tbh. It's the sound which prompted me to buy these earpods and I'm very disappointed with the sound quality and had they been offered at even half the price I got it at, it still wouldn't have been a good deal.

5821,7,JBL T205BT,"These pair of Headphones were supplied by Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. Were far from original, They appeared to be of some cheap quality China plastic stuff forget the sound quality also the packing was cheap with no seal and stickers partly removed and replaced from the headphone, I was told they are not returnable so they placed a replacement order with a promise to deliver original product however this time it was much worse faded plastic colour forget metal also it does not have any magnetic effect as mentioned in the product description just fake and duplicate waste of time and money please do not buy until and unless it's genuine, The seller does not sell genuine stuff

5822,7,JBL T205BT,"Accepted more from JBL.not satisfied.Good to listing music. sound quality awsome for music.but not satisfied with calling. to basic product not effective . No noise calling.you not able to call on road or traffic even while you drive bike at speed of 30km with the helmet.my main purpose to take a call when I busy with other activities.totally disappointed for calling and battery performance. I need to charge two times a day.

5823,7,JBL T205BT,"First of all i want to convey  JBL to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. I want to share my honest observation and experience about my JBL BT.1. I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. Now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is  i deposited it to the JBL service center on 9th may 2019, they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from JBL customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.Now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.I am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand JBL, in my opinion this is just a ordinary BT earphones with a tag of JBL and no quality features.I request  JBL to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.My service request no. is DL-E250519-25010
",1
5824,7,JBL T205BT,"One of the worst in so far I've used. Disconnects automatically. To connect it back I've to off and on sometimes. Totally disappointed.base is just enough. Battery life isn't that great to 3.5-4hrs on max usage. Can't use it for commute purposes. Maybe just gym or jogging. Little heavy on the weight side. So they'll drop pretty easily. Need to take care of that too. Totally dissatisfied. Returned the product. 🙏🏻

5825,7,JBL T205BT,"Sound quality is excellent, along with the noise cancellation, battery haven't drained since the time I've bought it (I'm not a regular user) but still it's great. Looks good, only problem I faced was fitting it into my ears as the ear piece is too wide (this is the problem I faced with almost all earphones). But the sound quality overcomes and makes your forget about it. I would definitely recommend it.
",5
5826,7,JBL T205BT,"Overall a good product but the only problem is the mic doesnt pic up the voice really well, either when putting it around ur neck u have to talk on high pitch or u have to keep the mic near to ur mouth so that the voice is clear & crisp to the other person on the line.
",4
5827,7,JBL T205BT,"I have been using Apple Airpods for 3 years now but after replacing multiple Airpods due to it get broke after using while.  I am a big fan of the sound quality offered by Apple it was very difficult to find a good alternative due to which I replaced over 10 headphones by big brand names. I must admit that JBL tried best to make it perfect choice Apple fans however the sound quality is not that great as my previous headset by Apple
",4
5828,7,JBL T205BT,"The product is very good for listening long hours of playback,  you won't even feel that you got your earphones. The sound is good too. The fit is excellent as it has earpods fits. The only major issue is that it's not for call(even the feature is there but the quality is bad) the earphone get disconnect automatically sometimes from Bluetooth and the left earpiece stopped working after 2 months usage(i got it replaced, which btw took 25days). See I myself is a that kind of person who doesn't forget it's earphone at home bcoz I can't survive the same city without it. I keep on listening to music for hours and hours. So if you are like me better raise your budget and buy bullet wireless.
",4
5829,7,JBL T205BT,"JBL should have supplied a pair of silicone eartips. Ear buds are getting easily slipped off from ear. Good sound clarity and 12mm driver is able to produce good bass. Happy with sound quality but the company should have provided silicone tips for noise isolation and good hold of ear tips.

5830,7,JBL T205BT,"I think worst Bluetooth headphones I have ever owned .It's totally incompatible with OnePlus cannot even speak on a call .Sound is okay nothing great .Battery life is bad I found it to give about 4 hours of useage.The way it fits into the ear is the worst of all .I don't recommend people buy this product.I'm on the verge of returning mine .

5831,7,JBL T205BT,"Useless earphone purchased it last month and with in 30 days of usage right speaker stopped working and absence of noise cancellation makes sound more horrible. Sheer wastage of money..

5832,7,JBL T205BT,"This product is just meant for music not for calls. There is lot of disturbance during the call & all the connectivity range is very poor. Not worth. My basic purpose was to take calls, but it did not served the purpose. Not a good buy.
",1
5833,7,JBL T205BT,"This is an attempt by JBL to make a different earpod style but ends up with an average product. The build quality is good and the sound quality is better but it's not like the apple 3.5 mm earpods. I have been using apple earpods since last 4-5 years and I know their quality of sound and bass. On the other hand this JBL has got earplugs made up of rubber and plastic and a metal finish which is rather painful for ears.

5834,7,JBL T205BT,"I am using this earphones since 2 months therefore I am the right person to tell you about this earphones.So the pros and cons of this earphones are:-Pros-1.Jbl brand name2.Good build qualityCons-1.low battery life i.e. 6 hours if you listen to song at a middle level volume.2.long time required for charging approx 2 hours3.noise cancellation is equal to zero4.this earphone hardly fit in any ear5.low sound6.Only bass no trebel and midsConclusion:-There are other better options it's a no from my side

5835,7,JBL T205BT,"Until it was working, the product was great. In fact, the other two pieces of the same item I ordered for friends are working fine, but this particular piece stopped working after 2 weeks. It simply cannot be switched on. The ten-day replacement window has closed, so it is unlikely that the seller will make a replacement. Given the fairly expensive model and a reliable brand, I am extremely disappointed with the product.

5836,7,JBL T205BT,"I spent a lot of time researching for a pair of headphones/ earphones. Was quite unsure of what I should buy. Sometimes reading too many reviews causes paralysis by analysis.Have used JBL as speakers, so thought how bad can these be?They are not bad. Not bad at all.Great sound, comfortable on the ears.Go buy them.

5837,7,JBL T205BT,"Sound quality is good.  Noise cancellation is OK. Battery life is also OK.Fits good in ear and no issue even after 4-5hours.Problem with ear buds. They came off within a month. Looks like JBL only concentrating on sound quality and temporary look.

5838,7,JBL T205BT,"Good product nice quality.. good sound quality. My only concern is the head set is not fitting properly in my ears as it's not a ear bud type. This is the only reason that I returned this product.

5839,7,JBL T205BT,"JBL t205bt is light weight, flexible and easy to carry. Sound quality is good. Bluetooth connects very fast. Build quality is very good. But the design of earpiece is little different from ibuds, hence ot is quite uncomfortable for ears. Bluetooth connection quality is not  good for calls. Sound cracks and breaks very often. Battery is ok for normal daily use. ( About 3 and half hours of music play with whole day connection with mobile can be expected). Biggest drawback is noise cancellation is terrible. You can not get good music in traffic or while riding.
",3
5840,7,JBL T205BT,"For a product thats made for mobility, this pair of earphones just is absolutely NOT made for the gym. The built quality is tacky, plasticky. Earphones are large and not in-ear so they slip out often. There's no clip or fastening mechanism to keep them attached or in-ear. Worst of all, 10 days of use in profuse sweat and moisture has killed them. The bluetooth connectivity comes on and off whenever it pleases, rendering them totally useless. Not at all worth the price.

5841,7,JBL T205BT,"I bought them from Amazon, ans they were okay, just average sounding earphones, but after a few days, Left earpiece started giving me problem such as low sound or sometimes no sound at all. I tried resetting them but nothing worked, I tried replacing them and the window got expired, I called Harman and they informed I need to send them to Delhi so they can have a look and check them, for like 2K I had to go through so much trouble. Although the delivery was on time as expected but things get worse when customer service is not good or helpful.

5847,7,JBL T205BT,"Headphones are excellent and sound quality is also good, but the only problem is that it is not very comfortable in ears. You cant use it continuously for more than 2hrs otherwise your ear will start paining.I did compare it to iPhone's headphone, and the difference and the reason for pain in ears was that the buds of JBL  headphones are bigger than that of iPhone's. And that's why not at all comfortable in ears.Now my ears are paining like hell and I had to see an ENT doctor.

5894,7,JBL T205BT,"While this is impressive in terms of money, sound and features lack in spades. If you are particular about sound then this is not a good pair of pods but comfort and value wise it is fine. Given a choice, I would not recommend this

5895,7,JBL T205BT,"The sound quality  is amazing compared to the wireless headphone of this price range. However it doesn't feel comfortable in the ears. Doesn't fit properly and it hurts if you are using for a long time.

",4
5897,7,JBL T205BT,"Sound is good clear. However doesn't meet the expectation in terms of bass when it explicitly claims pure bass earphones. Bass is 2.5/5. My reason to return was extreme ear pain as it absolutely didn't fit my ears. Couldn't peacefully listen for 5 mins at a stretch.

5898,7,JBL T205BT,"Good earphone with average bass.Metal plug fitting sometimes irritates in ear.Product quality is very Good.No magnet lock available for ear plugs.

PLUS the big miss is magnet behind the earphone! JBL HOW DID YOU MISS THAT!!! Its too difficult to carry them around !
",3
5906,7,JBL T205BT,"Best wireless earbuds in this range but still I returned it because of the design. The bud design are damn uncomfortable and will give you a pain after a while as there is no rubber buds. Otherwise wonderful sound and bass is also pure

5907,7,JBL T205BT,"The wireless earphones provides a seamless connection and a awesome playback... Pefrect for any situation.. The only draw back i see is battery could have been better but with a earphone of this size you cannot except more.. Totally value for money good build quality as you expect from jbl.

Initially, I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

6847,7,JBL T205BT,"I purchased 2 sets of this product and been using for 1 week.Pros:Earpod style, fits nicely, no pain even after using for hours. (This is the main reason I bought)Good sound quality and BassNice build quality and looks great.Cons:No Sir/Google Now-- Very Disappointing, If I knew this, I wouldn't have bought it. I thought every earphone will have a long press google now support. Feels useless while riding bike and while walking.Very low call volume -- This is serious issue while in traffic riding bike in India.Low battery life.Not sweat proof.Poor quality audio in Skype for Business. (App shows your device is causing low call quality)

6848,7,JBL T205BT,"I was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and I got to try it.The fitting in the ear is just OK; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.The Bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.The biggest let down for me was the audio quality. The highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. It feels like music being played in an empty hall. Also, the volume is also not very impressive. Definitely not worth the money.I currently use Boat earphones which I bought for Rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.Better go for MiVi or Boat.

6849,7,JBL T205BT,"I was looking for simple ear phones which remain just outside ear and not like other pieces which go inside the ear and we r totally cut off from outside.Such earphones were not available online, even in some good offline stores also.But one day while surfing I found these .I immediately ordered ., bass is deep and loud as claimed , light weight.

6850,7,JBL T205BT,"Bought this from jbl site and was available for 1999 Rs but black color was not available.I did lot of research on Bluetooth headphones before purchasing. Asked some of my friends already using some other company Bluetooth headset. All was having problem while calling. The other person on call hear some disturbance. Mainly I was looking for calling purpose. Following are the pros and cons according to me:Pros-no issue in call on both side. Perfect for callingBattery also seems good to me. Haven’t used for continuous day long but looks like it could hold for day long.Music sound also good. Was using iPhone headset and seems no much difference.In ear comfort also fineLook and quality wise no problemCons: no magnet but given one plastic kind of thing to hold both side wire togetherAuto turn off if not in use. For some it could be drawback and for some battery saving feature.I would suggest to purchase without any doubt.

6851,7,JBL T205BT,"Bought this doubtfully during the great Indian sale. Happy with purchase. I’m against in ear plugs as I feel uncomfortable beyond a point. This ear plug replicates apple earphones and sits on the ear.  Very comfortable and sound is enough to satisfy my needs. Also use it for taking calls so far no issues. Charging time 2hrs and lasts for a day.

6852,7,JBL T205BT,"I think JBL is just a brand name. To be honest this is good for nothing. Noise cancellation is zero, if I am on bike I dont even get which song is playing even on full volume. The bass is okay, not so appreciable as they market it the way it to be. I recently shifted from Sennheiser  brand and quite disappointed with this :-D

6853,7,JBL T205BT,"Before I write my review, I’d like to make clear that I DIDN’T purchase the item from the Amazon store. Regardless, I wish to write the review as I did come across one problem and would like others to consider it.I’ve had the earphones for almost about a month. I use it on a daily basis. And after first few weeks I noticed the ear-thing coming out. And I didn’t give much attention then but now it’s fully out and it’s bothersome.

Listen to some acoustics and bam, this will take you away on your own music studio, :P.....Bluetooth connectivity is okayish mediocre range works only with one device.Hence, as mentioned the pros doesn't justify the cons and nor the price.

I had boat rockers 400.Far better overall sound than that.When listened same song again in this headsets I observed more instruments clearly and where sound coming from unlike boat one.(ex - in Dino dil mera song)2. Battery- depending on song, I listened music with volume varying from 50% to 90%. Well, battery lasted 7hr+. No issue there.I had mi Bluetooth headset in mind.  But warranty was 6 month for that. 1 year jbl. So went with this.So it's like vivo oppo cameras beautify camera photos,same Chinese manufacturer amplify base to sound good.  It's just unnatural.

It isn't painful and they don't fall off, best is the use while laying sideways.- ~6 hrs on time: almost your days music- 1-1.5 hrs charge- excellent sound, excellent volume- yeah nice touch of baseCons:- the rubber linings do come off due to poor glue which becomes ineffective in heat.
